                1\n\nFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,\nThat thereby beauty\u2019s rose might never die,\nBut as the riper should by time decease,\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\nFeed\u2019st thy light\u2019s flame with self-substantial fuel,\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\nThou that art now the world\u2019s fresh ornament,\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\nAnd, tender churl, mak\u2019st waste in niggarding:\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\n  To eat the world\u2019s due, by the grave and thee.\n\n\n                    2\n\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty\u2019s field,\nThy youth\u2019s proud livery so gazed on now,\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held:\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\nHow much more praise deserv\u2019d thy beauty\u2019s use,\nIf thou couldst answer \u2018This fair child of mine\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,\u2019\nProving his beauty by succession thine.\n  This were to be new made when thou art old,\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel\u2019st it cold.\n\n\n                    3\n\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,\nNow is the time that face should form another,\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\nFor where is she so fair whose uneared womb\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb\nOf his self-love to stop posterity?\nThou art thy mother\u2019s glass and she in thee\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime,\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\n  But if thou live remembered not to be,\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.\n\n\n                    4\n\nUnthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,\nUpon thyself thy beauty\u2019s legacy?\nNature\u2019s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\nThen beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\nProfitless usurer why dost thou use\nSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?\nFor having traffic with thyself alone,\nThou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\n  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\n  Which used lives th\u2019 executor to be.\n\n\n                    5\n\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\nWill play the tyrants to the very same,\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o\u2019er-snowed and bareness every where:\nThen were not summer\u2019s distillation left\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty\u2019s effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\n  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\n  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.\n\n\n                    6\n\nThen let not winter\u2019s ragged hand deface,\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,\nWith beauty\u2019s treasure ere it be self-killed:\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\nThat\u2019s for thyself to breed another thee,\nOr ten times happier be it ten for one,\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art,\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\n  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,\n  To be death\u2019s conquest and make worms thine heir.\n\n\n                    7\n\nLo in the orient when the gracious light\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\nServing with looks his sacred majesty,\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car,\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\nThe eyes (fore duteous) now converted are\nFrom his low tract and look another way:\n  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\n\n\n                    8\n\nMusic to hear, why hear\u2019st thou music sadly?\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\nWhy lov\u2019st thou that which thou receiv\u2019st not gladly,\nOr else receiv\u2019st with pleasure thine annoy?\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\nBy unions married do offend thine ear,\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:\nMark how one string sweet husband to another,\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\nResembling sire, and child, and happy mother,\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\n  Sings this to thee, \u2018Thou single wilt prove none\u2019.\n\n\n                    9\n\nIs it for fear to wet a widow\u2019s eye,\nThat thou consum\u2019st thyself in single life?\nAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife,\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep,\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\nBy children\u2019s eyes, her husband\u2019s shape in mind:\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\nBut beauty\u2019s waste hath in the world an end,\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it:\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\n  That on himself such murd\u2019rous shame commits.\n\n\n                    10\n\nFor shame deny that thou bear\u2019st love to any\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\nGrant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\nBut that thou none lov\u2019st is most evident:\nFor thou art so possessed with murd\u2019rous hate,\nThat \u2019gainst thyself thou stick\u2019st not to conspire,\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:\nO change thy thought, that I may change my mind,\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\nBe as thy presence is gracious and kind,\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n\n\n                    11\n\nAs fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow\u2019st,\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest,\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow\u2019st,\nThou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay,\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\nAnd threescore year would make the world away:\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\nLook whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\n\n\n                    12\n\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\nAnd sable curls all silvered o\u2019er with white:\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd\nAnd summer\u2019s green all girded up in sheaves\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow,\n  And nothing \u2019gainst Time\u2019s scythe can make defence\n  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.\n\n\n                    13\n\nO that you were your self, but love you are\nNo longer yours, than you yourself here live,\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\nFind no determination, then you were\nYourself again after yourself\u2019s decease,\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter\u2019s day\nAnd barren rage of death\u2019s eternal cold?\n  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,\n  You had a father, let your son say so.\n\n\n                    14\n\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck,\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\nBut not to tell of good, or evil luck,\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons\u2019 quality,\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert:\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,\n  Thy end is truth\u2019s and beauty\u2019s doom and date.\n\n\n                    15\n\nWhen I consider everything that grows\nHolds in perfection but a little moment.\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment.\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky:\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory.\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay,\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with Decay\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\n\n\n                    16\n\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time?\nAnd fortify yourself in your decay\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\nAnd many maiden gardens yet unset,\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\nWhich this (Time\u2019s pencil) or my pupil pen\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\nCan make you live yourself in eyes of men.\n  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\n  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.\n\n\n                    17\n\nWho will believe my verse in time to come\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts:\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\nThe age to come would say this poet lies,\nSuch heavenly touches ne\u2019er touched earthly faces.\nSo should my papers (yellowed with their age)\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet\u2019s rage,\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\n  You should live twice,\u2014in it, and in my rhyme.\n\n\n                    18\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed,\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature\u2019s changing course untrimmed:\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st,\nNor shall death brag thou wand\u2019rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st,\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\n\n                    19\n\nDevouring Time blunt thou the lion\u2019s paws,\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood,\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger\u2019s jaws,\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet\u2019st,\nAnd do whate\u2019er thou wilt swift-footed Time\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets:\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime,\nO carve not with thy hours my love\u2019s fair brow,\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,\nHim in thy course untainted do allow,\nFor beauty\u2019s pattern to succeeding men.\n  Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\n\n\n                    20\n\nA woman\u2019s face with nature\u2019s own hand painted,\nHast thou the master mistress of my passion,\nA woman\u2019s gentle heart but not acquainted\nWith shifting change as is false women\u2019s fashion,\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth,\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\nWhich steals men\u2019s eyes and women\u2019s souls amazeth.\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created,\nTill nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\n  But since she pricked thee out for women\u2019s pleasure,\n  Mine be thy love and thy love\u2019s use their treasure.\n\n\n                    21\n\nSo is it not with me as with that muse,\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\nWho heaven it self for ornament doth use,\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea\u2019s rich gems:\nWith April\u2019s first-born flowers and all things rare,\nThat heaven\u2019s air in this huge rondure hems.\nO let me true in love but truly write,\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair,\nAs any mother\u2019s child, though not so bright\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven\u2019s air:\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\n\n\n                    22\n\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\nBut when in thee time\u2019s furrows I behold,\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\nO therefore love be of thyself so wary,\nAs I not for my self, but for thee will,\nBearing thy heart which I will keep so chary\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\n  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\n  Thou gav\u2019st me thine not to give back again.\n\n\n                    23\n\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\nWhose strength\u2019s abundance weakens his own heart;\nSo I for fear of trust, forget to say,\nThe perfect ceremony of love\u2019s rite,\nAnd in mine own love\u2019s strength seem to decay,\nO\u2019ercharged with burthen of mine own love\u2019s might:\nO let my looks be then the eloquence,\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.\n  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love\u2019s fine wit.\n\n\n                    24\n\nMine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,\nThy beauty\u2019s form in table of my heart,\nMy body is the frame wherein \u2019tis held,\nAnd perspective it is best painter\u2019s art.\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\nWhich in my bosom\u2019s shop is hanging still,\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\n\n\n                    25\n\nLet those who are in favour with their stars,\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\nWhilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars\nUnlooked for joy in that I honour most;\nGreat princes\u2019 favourites their fair leaves spread,\nBut as the marigold at the sun\u2019s eye,\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\n  Then happy I that love and am beloved\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n\n\n                    26\n\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit;\nTo thee I send this written embassage\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit.\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\nIn thy soul\u2019s thought (all naked) will bestow it:\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving,\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect,\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\n\n\n                    27\n\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tired,\nBut then begins a journey in my head\nTo work my mind, when body\u2019s work\u2019s expired.\nFor then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see.\nSave that my soul\u2019s imaginary sight\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\nWhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\n  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,\n  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.\n\n\n                    28\n\nHow can I then return in happy plight\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest?\nWhen day\u2019s oppression is not eased by night,\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed.\nAnd each (though enemies to either\u2019s reign)\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\nI tell the day to please him thou art bright,\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\nSo flatter I the swart-complexioned night,\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild\u2019st the even.\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\n  And night doth nightly make grief\u2019s length seem stronger\n\n\n                    29\n\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon my self and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\nDesiring this man\u2019s art, and that man\u2019s scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least,\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate,\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\n\n                    30\n\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time\u2019s waste:\nThen can I drown an eye (unused to flow)\nFor precious friends hid in death\u2019s dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love\u2019s long since cancelled woe,\nAnd moan th\u2019 expense of many a vanished sight.\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o\u2019er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\n  But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)\n  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.\n\n\n                    31\n\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\nAnd there reigns love and all love\u2019s loving parts,\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\nHath dear religious love stol\u2019n from mine eye,\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear,\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie.\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\nThat due of many, now is thine alone.\n  Their images I loved, I view in thee,\n  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.\n\n\n                    32\n\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\nWhen that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:\nCompare them with the bett\u2019ring of the time,\nAnd though they be outstripped by every pen,\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\nO then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,\n\u2019Had my friend\u2019s Muse grown with this growing age,\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\n  Theirs for their style I\u2019ll read, his for his love\u2019.\n\n\n                    33\n\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen,\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\nKissing with golden face the meadows green;\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride,\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow,\nBut out alack, he was but one hour mine,\nThe region cloud hath masked him from me now.\n  Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,\n  Suns of the world may stain, when heaven\u2019s sun staineth.\n\n\n                    34\n\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\nTo let base clouds o\u2019ertake me in my way,\nHiding thy brav\u2019ry in their rotten smoke?\n\u2019Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief,\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss,\nTh\u2019 offender\u2019s sorrow lends but weak relief\nTo him that bears the strong offence\u2019s cross.\n  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\n  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.\n\n\n                    35\n\nNo more be grieved at that which thou hast done,\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\nMy self corrupting salving thy amiss,\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are:\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense;\nThy adverse party is thy advocate,\nAnd \u2019gainst my self a lawful plea commence:\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate,\n  That I an accessary needs must be,\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\n\n\n                    36\n\nLet me confess that we two must be twain,\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\nWhich though it alter not love\u2019s sole effect,\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love\u2019s delight.\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    37\n\nAs a decrepit father takes delight,\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\nSo I, made lame by Fortune\u2019s dearest spite\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\nOr any of these all, or all, or more\nEntitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\nI make my love engrafted to this store:\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give,\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed,\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live:\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,\n  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.\n\n\n                    38\n\nHow can my Muse want subject to invent\nWhile thou dost breathe that pour\u2019st into my verse,\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent,\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\nO give thyself the thanks if aught in me,\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight,\nFor who\u2019s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\nWhen thou thyself dost give invention light?\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate,\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\n  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\n\n\n                    39\n\nO how thy worth with manners may I sing,\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring:\nAnd what is\u2019t but mine own when I praise thee?\nEven for this, let us divided live,\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\nThat by this separation I may give:\nThat due to thee which thou deserv\u2019st alone:\nO absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\n\n\n                    40\n\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all,\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:\nThen if for my love, thou my love receivest,\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,\nBut yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest\nBy wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\nI do forgive thy robbery gentle thief\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\nAnd yet love knows it is a greater grief\nTo bear greater wrong, than hate\u2019s known injury.\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\n  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\n\n\n                    41\n\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman\u2019s son,\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\nAy me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\nAnd chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\n  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\n  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\n\n\n                    42\n\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly,\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye,\nThou dost love her, because thou know\u2019st I love her,\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\nSuff\u2019ring my friend for my sake to approve her.\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love\u2019s gain,\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss,\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross,\n  But here\u2019s the joy, my friend and I are one,\n  Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.\n\n\n                    43\n\nWhen most I wink then do mine eyes best see,\nFor all the day they view things unrespected,\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\nThen thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright\nHow would thy shadow\u2019s form, form happy show,\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\nHow would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\n\n\n                    44\n\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\nInjurious distance should not stop my way,\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay,\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\nUpon the farthest earth removed from thee,\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\nBut ah, thought kills me that I am not thought\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\nI must attend, time\u2019s leisure with my moan.\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow,\n  But heavy tears, badges of either\u2019s woe.\n\n\n                    45\n\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire,\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide,\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\nMy life being made of four, with two alone,\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.\nUntil life\u2019s composition be recured,\nBy those swift messengers returned from thee,\nWho even but now come back again assured,\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me.\n  This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,\n  I send them back again and straight grow sad.\n\n\n                    46\n\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight,\nMine eye, my heart thy picture\u2019s sight would bar,\nMy heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\nA closet never pierced with crystal eyes;\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\nTo side this title is impanelled\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,\nAnd by their verdict is determined\nThe clear eye\u2019s moiety, and the dear heart\u2019s part.\n  As thus, mine eye\u2019s due is thy outward part,\n  And my heart\u2019s right, thy inward love of heart.\n\n\n                    47\n\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other,\nWhen that mine eye is famished for a look,\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;\nWith my love\u2019s picture then my eye doth feast,\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart:\nAnother time mine eye is my heart\u2019s guest,\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part.\nSo either by thy picture or my love,\nThyself away, art present still with me,\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee.\n  Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\n  Awakes my heart, to heart\u2019s and eye\u2019s delight.\n\n\n                    48\n\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\nThat to my use it might unused stay\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\nThee have I not locked up in any chest,\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol\u2019n I fear,\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\n\n\n                    49\n\nAgainst that time (if ever that time come)\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\nCalled to that audit by advised respects,\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,\nWhen love converted from the thing it was\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part,\n  To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,\n  Since why to love, I can allege no cause.\n\n\n                    50\n\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\nWhen what I seek (my weary travel\u2019s end)\nDoth teach that case and that repose to say\n\u2019Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.\u2019\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\nHis rider loved not speed being made from thee:\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side,\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\n  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.\n\n\n                    51\n\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence,\nOf my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,\nFrom where thou art, why should I haste me thence?\nTill I return of posting is no need.\nO what excuse will my poor beast then find,\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\nThen should I spur though mounted on the wind,\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know,\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace,\nTherefore desire (of perfect\u2019st love being made)\nShall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race,\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:\n  Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\n  Towards thee I\u2019ll run, and give him leave to go.\n\n\n                    52\n\nSo am I as the rich whose blessed key,\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\nSince seldom coming in that long year set,\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\nBy new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\n  Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.\n\n\n                    53\n\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\nSince every one, hath every one, one shade,\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend:\nDescribe Adonis and the counterfeit,\nIs poorly imitated after you,\nOn Helen\u2019s cheek all art of beauty set,\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\nThe other as your bounty doth appear,\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\n  In all external grace you have some part,\n  But you like none, none you for constant heart.\n\n\n                    54\n\nO how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\nFor that sweet odour, which doth in it live:\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye,\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,\nWhen summer\u2019s breath their masked buds discloses:\nBut for their virtue only is their show,\nThey live unwooed, and unrespected fade,\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,\nOf their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:\n  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\n  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.\n\n\n                    55\n\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\nThan unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\nNor Mars his sword, nor war\u2019s quick fire shall burn:\nThe living record of your memory.\n\u2019Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity\nShall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\n  So till the judgement that yourself arise,\n  You live in this, and dwell in lovers\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n                    56\n\nSweet love renew thy force, be it not said\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\nWhich but to-day by feeding is allayed,\nTo-morrow sharpened in his former might.\nSo love be thou, although to-day thou fill\nThy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\nTo-morrow see again, and do not kill\nThe spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new,\nCome daily to the banks, that when they see:\nReturn of love, more blest may be the view.\n  Or call it winter, which being full of care,\n  Makes summer\u2019s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\n\n\n                    57\n\nBeing your slave what should I do but tend,\nUpon the hours, and times of your desire?\nI have no precious time at all to spend;\nNor services to do till you require.\nNor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,\nWhilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour,\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu.\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought,\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\nBut like a sad slave stay and think of nought\nSave where you are, how happy you make those.\n  So true a fool is love, that in your will,\n  (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.\n\n\n                    58\n\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\nOr at your hand th\u2019 account of hours to crave,\nBeing your vassal bound to stay your leisure.\nO let me suffer (being at your beck)\nTh\u2019 imprisoned absence of your liberty,\nAnd patience tame to sufferance bide each check,\nWithout accusing you of injury.\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong,\nThat you yourself may privilage your time\nTo what you will, to you it doth belong,\nYourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\n  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\n  Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\n\n\n                    59\n\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is,\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\nWhich labouring for invention bear amiss\nThe second burthen of a former child!\nO that record could with a backward look,\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\nShow me your image in some antique book,\nSince mind at first in character was done.\nThat I might see what the old world could say,\nTo this composed wonder of your frame,\nWhether we are mended, or whether better they,\nOr whether revolution be the same.\n  O sure I am the wits of former days,\n  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\n\n\n                    60\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\nNativity once in the main of light,\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\nCrooked eclipses \u2019gainst his glory fight,\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty\u2019s brow,\nFeeds on the rarities of nature\u2019s truth,\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\n  And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\n  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n\n                    61\n\nIs it thy will, thy image should keep open\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\nIs it thy spirit that thou send\u2019st from thee\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\nThe scope and tenure of thy jealousy?\nO no, thy love though much, is not so great,\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake,\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\nTo play the watchman ever for thy sake.\n  For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\n  From me far off, with others all too near.\n\n\n                    62\n\nSin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,\nAnd all my soul, and all my every part;\nAnd for this sin there is no remedy,\nIt is so grounded inward in my heart.\nMethinks no face so gracious is as mine,\nNo shape so true, no truth of such account,\nAnd for my self mine own worth do define,\nAs I all other in all worths surmount.\nBut when my glass shows me my self indeed\nbeated and chopt with tanned antiquity,\nMine own self-love quite contrary I read:\nSelf, so self-loving were iniquity.\n  \u2019Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,\n  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.\n\n\n                    63\n\nAgainst my love shall be as I am now\nWith Time\u2019s injurious hand crushed and o\u2019erworn,\nWhen hours have drained his blood and filled his brow\nWith lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn\nHath travelled on to age\u2019s steepy night,\nAnd all those beauties whereof now he\u2019s king\nAre vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\nStealing away the treasure of his spring:\nFor such a time do I now fortify\nAgainst confounding age\u2019s cruel knife,\nThat he shall never cut from memory\nMy sweet love\u2019s beauty, though my lover\u2019s life.\n  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\n  And they shall live, and he in them still green.\n\n\n                    64\n\nWhen I have seen by Time\u2019s fell hand defaced\nThe rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,\nWhen sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,\nAnd brass eternal slave to mortal rage.\nWhen I have seen the hungry ocean gain\nAdvantage on the kingdom of the shore,\nAnd the firm soil win of the watery main,\nIncreasing store with loss, and loss with store.\nWhen I have seen such interchange of State,\nOr state it self confounded, to decay,\nRuin hath taught me thus to ruminate:\nThat Time will come and take my love away.\n  This thought is as a death which cannot choose\n  But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.\n\n\n                    65\n\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\nBut sad mortality o\u2019ersways their power,\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\nO how shall summer\u2019s honey breath hold out,\nAgainst the wrackful siege of batt\u2019ring days,\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\nNor gates of steel so strong but time decays?\nO fearful meditation, where alack,\nShall Time\u2019s best jewel from Time\u2019s chest lie hid?\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\n  O none, unless this miracle have might,\n  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\n\n\n                    66\n\nTired with all these, for restful death I cry:\nAs to behold desert a beggar born,\nAnd needy nothing trimmed in jollity,\nAnd purest faith unhappily forsworn,\nAnd gilded honour shamefully misplaced,\nAnd maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\nAnd right perfection wrongfully disgraced,\nAnd strength by limping sway disabled\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\nAnd folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\nAnd simple truth miscalled simplicity,\nAnd captive good attending captain ill.\n  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\n  Save that to die, I leave my love alone.\n\n\n                    67\n\nAh wherefore with infection should he live,\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve,\nAnd lace it self with his society?\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek,\nAnd steal dead seeming of his living hue?\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek,\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\nWhy should he live, now nature bankrupt is,\nBeggared of blood to blush through lively veins,\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\nAnd proud of many, lives upon his gains?\n  O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,\n  In days long since, before these last so bad.\n\n\n                    68\n\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were born,\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow:\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\nThe right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\nTo live a second life on second head,\nEre beauty\u2019s dead fleece made another gay:\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\nWithout all ornament, it self and true,\nMaking no summer of another\u2019s green,\nRobbing no old to dress his beauty new,\n  And him as for a map doth Nature store,\n  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\n\n\n                    69\n\nThose parts of thee that the world\u2019s eye doth view,\nWant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:\nAll tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,\nUttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\nThy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,\nBut those same tongues that give thee so thine own,\nIn other accents do this praise confound\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\nAnd that in guess they measure by thy deeds,\nThen churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\n  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\n  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\n\n\n                    70\n\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\nFor slander\u2019s mark was ever yet the fair,\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\nA crow that flies in heaven\u2019s sweetest air.\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve,\nThy worth the greater being wooed of time,\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\nAnd thou present\u2019st a pure unstained prime.\nThou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\nEither not assailed, or victor being charged,\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\nTo tie up envy, evermore enlarged,\n  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\n  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\n\n\n                    71\n\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead,\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\nFrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\nNay if you read this line, remember not,\nThe hand that writ it, for I love you so,\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\nO if, I say, you look upon this verse,\nWhen I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse;\nBut let your love even with my life decay.\n  Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\n  And mock you with me after I am gone.\n\n\n                    72\n\nO lest the world should task you to recite,\nWhat merit lived in me that you should love\nAfter my death, dear love, forget me quite,\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove.\nUnless you would devise some virtuous lie,\nTo do more for me than mine own desert,\nAnd hang more praise upon deceased I,\nThan niggard truth would willingly impart:\nO lest your true love may seem false in this,\nThat you for love speak well of me untrue,\nMy name be buried where my body is,\nAnd live no more to shame nor me, nor you.\n  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\n  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\n\n\n                    73\n\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold,\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day,\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\nDeath\u2019s second self that seals up all in rest.\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\nAs the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\n  This thou perceiv\u2019st, which makes thy love more strong,\n  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\n\n\n                    74\n\nBut be contented when that fell arrest,\nWithout all bail shall carry me away,\nMy life hath in this line some interest,\nWhich for memorial still with thee shall stay.\nWhen thou reviewest this, thou dost review,\nThe very part was consecrate to thee,\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due,\nMy spirit is thine the better part of me,\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead,\nThe coward conquest of a wretch\u2019s knife,\nToo base of thee to be remembered,\n  The worth of that, is that which it contains,\n  And that is this, and this with thee remains.\n\n\n                    75\n\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\nOr as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;\nAnd for the peace of you I hold such strife\nAs \u2019twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\nNow proud as an enjoyer, and anon\nDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure,\nNow counting best to be with you alone,\nThen bettered that the world may see my pleasure,\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look,\nPossessing or pursuing no delight\nSave what is had, or must from you be took.\n  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\n  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\n\n\n                    76\n\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride?\nSo far from variation or quick change?\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\nTo new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\nO know sweet love I always write of you,\nAnd you and love are still my argument:\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\nSpending again what is already spent:\n  For as the sun is daily new and old,\n  So is my love still telling what is told.\n\n\n                    77\n\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste,\nThese vacant leaves thy mind\u2019s imprint will bear,\nAnd of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\nThe wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,\nOf mouthed graves will give thee memory,\nThou by thy dial\u2019s shady stealth mayst know,\nTime\u2019s thievish progress to eternity.\nLook what thy memory cannot contain,\nCommit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\nThose children nursed, delivered from thy brain,\nTo take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\n  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\n  Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.\n\n\n                    78\n\nSo oft have I invoked thee for my muse,\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse,\nAs every alien pen hath got my use,\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\nHave added feathers to the learned\u2019s wing,\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\nWhose influence is thine, and born of thee,\nIn others\u2019 works thou dost but mend the style,\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces graced be.\n  But thou art all my art, and dost advance\n  As high as learning, my rude ignorance.\n\n\n                    79\n\nWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\nMy verse alone had all thy gentle grace,\nBut now my gracious numbers are decayed,\nAnd my sick muse doth give an other place.\nI grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument\nDeserves the travail of a worthier pen,\nYet what of thee thy poet doth invent,\nHe robs thee of, and pays it thee again,\nHe lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,\nFrom thy behaviour, beauty doth he give\nAnd found it in thy cheek: he can afford\nNo praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\n  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\n  Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\n\n\n                    80\n\nO how I faint when I of you do write,\nKnowing a better spirit doth use your name,\nAnd in the praise thereof spends all his might,\nTo make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.\nBut since your worth, wide as the ocean is,\nThe humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\nMy saucy bark (inferior far to his)\nOn your broad main doth wilfully appear.\nYour shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\nWhilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,\nOr (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,\nHe of tall building, and of goodly pride.\n  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,\n  The worst was this: my love was my decay.\n\n\n                    81\n\nOr I shall live your epitaph to make,\nOr you survive when I in earth am rotten,\nFrom hence your memory death cannot take,\nAlthough in me each part will be forgotten.\nYour name from hence immortal life shall have,\nThough I (once gone) to all the world must die,\nThe earth can yield me but a common grave,\nWhen you entombed in men\u2019s eyes shall lie,\nYour monument shall be my gentle verse,\nWhich eyes not yet created shall o\u2019er-read,\nAnd tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\nWhen all the breathers of this world are dead,\n  You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,\n  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\n\n\n                    82\n\nI grant thou wert not married to my muse,\nAnd therefore mayst without attaint o\u2019erlook\nThe dedicated words which writers use\nOf their fair subject, blessing every book.\nThou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\nFinding thy worth a limit past my praise,\nAnd therefore art enforced to seek anew,\nSome fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\nAnd do so love, yet when they have devised,\nWhat strained touches rhetoric can lend,\nThou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,\nIn true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.\n  And their gross painting might be better used,\n  Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.\n\n\n                    83\n\nI never saw that you did painting need,\nAnd therefore to your fair no painting set,\nI found (or thought I found) you did exceed,\nThat barren tender of a poet\u2019s debt:\nAnd therefore have I slept in your report,\nThat you yourself being extant well might show,\nHow far a modern quill doth come too short,\nSpeaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\nThis silence for my sin you did impute,\nWhich shall be most my glory being dumb,\nFor I impair not beauty being mute,\nWhen others would give life, and bring a tomb.\n  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,\n  Than both your poets can in praise devise.\n\n\n                    84\n\nWho is it that says most, which can say more,\nThan this rich praise: that you alone are you,\nIn whose confine immured is the store,\nWhich should example where your equal grew.\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell,\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory,\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell,\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story.\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\nMaking his style admired every where.\n  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\n  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\n\n\n                    85\n\nMy tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,\nWhile comments of your praise richly compiled,\nReserve their character with golden quill,\nAnd precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\nI think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,\nAnd like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,\nTo every hymn that able spirit affords,\nIn polished form of well refined pen.\nHearing you praised, I say \u2019tis so, \u2019tis true,\nAnd to the most of praise add something more,\nBut that is in my thought, whose love to you\n(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,\n  Then others, for the breath of words respect,\n  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\n\n\n                    86\n\nWas it the proud full sail of his great verse,\nBound for the prize of (all too precious) you,\nThat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\nMaking their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\nWas it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\nAbove a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\nNo, neither he, nor his compeers by night\nGiving him aid, my verse astonished.\nHe nor that affable familiar ghost\nWhich nightly gulls him with intelligence,\nAs victors of my silence cannot boast,\nI was not sick of any fear from thence.\n  But when your countenance filled up his line,\n  Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.\n\n\n                    87\n\nFarewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\nAnd like enough thou know\u2019st thy estimate,\nThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:\nMy bonds in thee are all determinate.\nFor how do I hold thee but by thy granting,\nAnd for that riches where is my deserving?\nThe cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\nAnd so my patent back again is swerving.\nThyself thou gav\u2019st, thy own worth then not knowing,\nOr me to whom thou gav\u2019st it, else mistaking,\nSo thy great gift upon misprision growing,\nComes home again, on better judgement making.\n  Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,\n  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\n\n\n                    88\n\nWhen thou shalt be disposed to set me light,\nAnd place my merit in the eye of scorn,\nUpon thy side, against my self I\u2019ll fight,\nAnd prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:\nWith mine own weakness being best acquainted,\nUpon thy part I can set down a story\nOf faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:\nThat thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:\nAnd I by this will be a gainer too,\nFor bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\nThe injuries that to my self I do,\nDoing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\n  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\n  That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.\n\n\n                    89\n\nSay that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\nAnd I will comment upon that offence,\nSpeak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:\nAgainst thy reasons making no defence.\nThou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,\nTo set a form upon desired change,\nAs I\u2019ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,\nI will acquaintance strangle and look strange:\nBe absent from thy walks and in my tongue,\nThy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\nLest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,\nAnd haply of our old acquaintance tell.\n  For thee, against my self I\u2019ll vow debate,\n  For I must ne\u2019er love him whom thou dost hate.\n\n\n                    90\n\nThen hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,\nNow while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\njoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss:\nAh do not, when my heart hath \u2019scaped this sorrow,\nCome in the rearward of a conquered woe,\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\nWhen other petty griefs have done their spite,\nBut in the onset come, so shall I taste\nAt first the very worst of fortune\u2019s might.\n  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\n  Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.\n\n\n                    91\n\nSome glory in their birth, some in their skill,\nSome in their wealth, some in their body\u2019s force,\nSome in their garments though new-fangled ill:\nSome in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.\nAnd every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\nWherein it finds a joy above the rest,\nBut these particulars are not my measure,\nAll these I better in one general best.\nThy love is better than high birth to me,\nRicher than wealth, prouder than garments\u2019 costs,\nOf more delight than hawks and horses be:\nAnd having thee, of all men\u2019s pride I boast.\n  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,\n  All this away, and me most wretched make.\n\n\n                    92\n\nBut do thy worst to steal thyself away,\nFor term of life thou art assured mine,\nAnd life no longer than thy love will stay,\nFor it depends upon that love of thine.\nThen need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\nWhen in the least of them my life hath end,\nI see, a better state to me belongs\nThan that, which on thy humour doth depend.\nThou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\nSince that my life on thy revolt doth lie,\nO what a happy title do I find,\nHappy to have thy love, happy to die!\n  But what\u2019s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\n  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\n\n\n                    93\n\nSo shall I live, supposing thou art true,\nLike a deceived husband, so love\u2019s face,\nMay still seem love to me, though altered new:\nThy looks with me, thy heart in other place.\nFor there can live no hatred in thine eye,\nTherefore in that I cannot know thy change,\nIn many\u2019s looks, the false heart\u2019s history\nIs writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.\nBut heaven in thy creation did decree,\nThat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,\nWhate\u2019er thy thoughts, or thy heart\u2019s workings be,\nThy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\n  How like Eve\u2019s apple doth thy beauty grow,\n  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.\n\n\n                    94\n\nThey that have power to hurt, and will do none,\nThat do not do the thing, they most do show,\nWho moving others, are themselves as stone,\nUnmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:\nThey rightly do inherit heaven\u2019s graces,\nAnd husband nature\u2019s riches from expense,\nThey are the lords and owners of their faces,\nOthers, but stewards of their excellence:\nThe summer\u2019s flower is to the summer sweet,\nThough to it self, it only live and die,\nBut if that flower with base infection meet,\nThe basest weed outbraves his dignity:\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,\n  Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.\n\n\n                    95\n\nHow sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,\nWhich like a canker in the fragrant rose,\nDoth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\nO in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!\nThat tongue that tells the story of thy days,\n(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)\nCannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,\nNaming thy name, blesses an ill report.\nO what a mansion have those vices got,\nWhich for their habitation chose out thee,\nWhere beauty\u2019s veil doth cover every blot,\nAnd all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!\n  Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,\n  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.\n\n\n                    96\n\nSome say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,\nSome say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,\nBoth grace and faults are loved of more and less:\nThou mak\u2019st faults graces, that to thee resort:\nAs on the finger of a throned queen,\nThe basest jewel will be well esteemed:\nSo are those errors that in thee are seen,\nTo truths translated, and for true things deemed.\nHow many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\nIf like a lamb he could his looks translate!\nHow many gazers mightst thou lead away,\nIf thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    97\n\nHow like a winter hath my absence been\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\nWhat old December\u2019s bareness everywhere!\nAnd yet this time removed was summer\u2019s time,\nThe teeming autumn big with rich increase,\nBearing the wanton burden of the prime,\nLike widowed wombs after their lords\u2019 decease:\nYet this abundant issue seemed to me\nBut hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\nAnd thou away, the very birds are mute.\n  Or if they sing, \u2019tis with so dull a cheer,\n  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter\u2019s near.\n\n\n                    98\n\nFrom you have I been absent in the spring,\nWhen proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)\nHath put a spirit of youth in every thing:\nThat heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.\nYet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\nOf different flowers in odour and in hue,\nCould make me any summer\u2019s story tell:\nOr from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\nNor did I wonder at the lily\u2019s white,\nNor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,\nThey were but sweet, but figures of delight:\nDrawn after you, you pattern of all those.\n  Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,\n  As with your shadow I with these did play.\n\n\n                    99\n\nThe forward violet thus did I chide,\nSweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\nIf not from my love\u2019s breath? The purple pride\nWhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells,\nIn my love\u2019s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.\nThe lily I condemned for thy hand,\nAnd buds of marjoram had stol\u2019n thy hair,\nThe roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\nOne blushing shame, another white despair:\nA third nor red, nor white, had stol\u2019n of both,\nAnd to his robbery had annexed thy breath,\nBut for his theft in pride of all his growth\nA vengeful canker eat him up to death.\n  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\n  But sweet, or colour it had stol\u2019n from thee.\n\n\n                    100\n\nWhere art thou Muse that thou forget\u2019st so long,\nTo speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\nSpend\u2019st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\nDarkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\nReturn forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,\nIn gentle numbers time so idly spent,\nSing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,\nAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.\nRise resty Muse, my love\u2019s sweet face survey,\nIf time have any wrinkle graven there,\nIf any, be a satire to decay,\nAnd make time\u2019s spoils despised everywhere.\n  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\n  So thou prevent\u2019st his scythe, and crooked knife.\n\n\n                    101\n\nO truant Muse what shall be thy amends,\nFor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\nBoth truth and beauty on my love depends:\nSo dost thou too, and therein dignified:\nMake answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,\n\u2019Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,\nBeauty no pencil, beauty\u2019s truth to lay:\nBut best is best, if never intermixed\u2019?\nBecause he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\nExcuse not silence so, for\u2019t lies in thee,\nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb:\nAnd to be praised of ages yet to be.\n  Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,\n  To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.\n\n\n                    102\n\nMy love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,\nI love not less, though less the show appear,\nThat love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,\nThe owner\u2019s tongue doth publish every where.\nOur love was new, and then but in the spring,\nWhen I was wont to greet it with my lays,\nAs Philomel in summer\u2019s front doth sing,\nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\nNot that the summer is less pleasant now\nThan when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\nBut that wild music burthens every bough,\nAnd sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n  Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:\n  Because I would not dull you with my song.\n\n\n                    103\n\nAlack what poverty my muse brings forth,\nThat having such a scope to show her pride,\nThe argument all bare is of more worth\nThan when it hath my added praise beside.\nO blame me not if I no more can write!\nLook in your glass and there appears a face,\nThat over-goes my blunt invention quite,\nDulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\nWere it not sinful then striving to mend,\nTo mar the subject that before was well?\nFor to no other pass my verses tend,\nThan of your graces and your gifts to tell.\n  And more, much more than in my verse can sit,\n  Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.\n\n\n                    104\n\nTo me fair friend you never can be old,\nFor as you were when first your eye I eyed,\nSuch seems your beauty still: three winters cold,\nHave from the forests shook three summers\u2019 pride,\nThree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,\nIn process of the seasons have I seen,\nThree April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,\nSince first I saw you fresh which yet are green.\nAh yet doth beauty like a dial hand,\nSteal from his figure, and no pace perceived,\nSo your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand\nHath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.\n  For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,\n  Ere you were born was beauty\u2019s summer dead.\n\n\n                    105\n\nLet not my love be called idolatry,\nNor my beloved as an idol show,\nSince all alike my songs and praises be\nTo one, of one, still such, and ever so.\nKind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\nStill constant in a wondrous excellence,\nTherefore my verse to constancy confined,\nOne thing expressing, leaves out difference.\nFair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\nFair, kind, and true, varying to other words,\nAnd in this change is my invention spent,\nThree themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n  Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.\n  Which three till now, never kept seat in one.\n\n\n                    106\n\nWhen in the chronicle of wasted time,\nI see descriptions of the fairest wights,\nAnd beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\nIn praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,\nThen in the blazon of sweet beauty\u2019s best,\nOf hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\nI see their antique pen would have expressed,\nEven such a beauty as you master now.\nSo all their praises are but prophecies\nOf this our time, all you prefiguring,\nAnd for they looked but with divining eyes,\nThey had not skill enough your worth to sing:\n  For we which now behold these present days,\n  Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\n\n\n                    107\n\nNot mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,\nOf the wide world, dreaming on things to come,\nCan yet the lease of my true love control,\nSupposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\nThe mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\nAnd the sad augurs mock their own presage,\nIncertainties now crown themselves assured,\nAnd peace proclaims olives of endless age.\nNow with the drops of this most balmy time,\nMy love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\nSince spite of him I\u2019ll live in this poor rhyme,\nWhile he insults o\u2019er dull and speechless tribes.\n  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n  When tyrants\u2019 crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n\n\n                    108\n\nWhat\u2019s in the brain that ink may character,\nWhich hath not figured to thee my true spirit,\nWhat\u2019s new to speak, what now to register,\nThat may express my love, or thy dear merit?\nNothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,\nI must each day say o\u2019er the very same,\nCounting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\nEven as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\nSo that eternal love in love\u2019s fresh case,\nWeighs not the dust and injury of age,\nNor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\nBut makes antiquity for aye his page,\n  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,\n  Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n\n\n                    109\n\nO never say that I was false of heart,\nThough absence seemed my flame to qualify,\nAs easy might I from my self depart,\nAs from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\nThat is my home of love, if I have ranged,\nLike him that travels I return again,\nJust to the time, not with the time exchanged,\nSo that my self bring water for my stain,\nNever believe though in my nature reigned,\nAll frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\nThat it could so preposterously be stained,\nTo leave for nothing all thy sum of good:\n  For nothing this wide universe I call,\n  Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.\n\n\n                    110\n\nAlas \u2019tis true, I have gone here and there,\nAnd made my self a motley to the view,\nGored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\nMade old offences of affections new.\nMost true it is, that I have looked on truth\nAskance and strangely: but by all above,\nThese blenches gave my heart another youth,\nAnd worse essays proved thee my best of love.\nNow all is done, have what shall have no end,\nMine appetite I never more will grind\nOn newer proof, to try an older friend,\nA god in love, to whom I am confined.\n  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,\n  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.\n\n\n                    111\n\nO for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\nThat did not better for my life provide,\nThan public means which public manners breeds.\nThence comes it that my name receives a brand,\nAnd almost thence my nature is subdued\nTo what it works in, like the dyer\u2019s hand:\nPity me then, and wish I were renewed,\nWhilst like a willing patient I will drink,\nPotions of eisel \u2019gainst my strong infection,\nNo bitterness that I will bitter think,\nNor double penance to correct correction.\n  Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,\n  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.\n\n\n                    112\n\nYour love and pity doth th\u2019 impression fill,\nWhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,\nFor what care I who calls me well or ill,\nSo you o\u2019er-green my bad, my good allow?\nYou are my all the world, and I must strive,\nTo know my shames and praises from your tongue,\nNone else to me, nor I to none alive,\nThat my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.\nIn so profound abysm I throw all care\nOf others\u2019 voices, that my adder\u2019s sense,\nTo critic and to flatterer stopped are:\nMark how with my neglect I do dispense.\n  You are so strongly in my purpose bred,\n  That all the world besides methinks are dead.\n\n\n                    113\n\nSince I left you, mine eye is in my mind,\nAnd that which governs me to go about,\nDoth part his function, and is partly blind,\nSeems seeing, but effectually is out:\nFor it no form delivers to the heart\nOf bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,\nOf his quick objects hath the mind no part,\nNor his own vision holds what it doth catch:\nFor if it see the rud\u2019st or gentlest sight,\nThe most sweet favour or deformed\u2019st creature,\nThe mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:\nThe crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.\n  Incapable of more, replete with you,\n  My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.\n\n\n                    114\n\nOr whether doth my mind being crowned with you\nDrink up the monarch\u2019s plague this flattery?\nOr whether shall I say mine eye saith true,\nAnd that your love taught it this alchemy?\nTo make of monsters, and things indigest,\nSuch cherubins as your sweet self resemble,\nCreating every bad a perfect best\nAs fast as objects to his beams assemble:\nO \u2019tis the first, \u2019tis flattery in my seeing,\nAnd my great mind most kingly drinks it up,\nMine eye well knows what with his gust is \u2019greeing,\nAnd to his palate doth prepare the cup.\n  If it be poisoned, \u2019tis the lesser sin,\n  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.\n\n\n                    115\n\nThose lines that I before have writ do lie,\nEven those that said I could not love you dearer,\nYet then my judgement knew no reason why,\nMy most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,\nBut reckoning time, whose millioned accidents\nCreep in \u2019twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,\nTan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp\u2019st intents,\nDivert strong minds to the course of alt\u2019ring things:\nAlas why fearing of time\u2019s tyranny,\nMight I not then say \u2018Now I love you best,\u2019\nWhen I was certain o\u2019er incertainty,\nCrowning the present, doubting of the rest?\n  Love is a babe, then might I not say so\n  To give full growth to that which still doth grow.\n\n\n                    116\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments, love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\nO no, it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wand\u2019ring bark,\nWhose worth\u2019s unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove\u2019s not Time\u2019s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle\u2019s compass come,\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom:\n  If this be error and upon me proved,\n  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\n\n\n                    117\n\nAccuse me thus, that I have scanted all,\nWherein I should your great deserts repay,\nForgot upon your dearest love to call,\nWhereto all bonds do tie me day by day,\nThat I have frequent been with unknown minds,\nAnd given to time your own dear-purchased right,\nThat I have hoisted sail to all the winds\nWhich should transport me farthest from your sight.\nBook both my wilfulness and errors down,\nAnd on just proof surmise, accumulate,\nBring me within the level of your frown,\nBut shoot not at me in your wakened hate:\n  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove\n  The constancy and virtue of your love.\n\n\n                    118\n\nLike as to make our appetite more keen\nWith eager compounds we our palate urge,\nAs to prevent our maladies unseen,\nWe sicken to shun sickness when we purge.\nEven so being full of your ne\u2019er-cloying sweetness,\nTo bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\nAnd sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,\nTo be diseased ere that there was true needing.\nThus policy in love t\u2019 anticipate\nThe ills that were not, grew to faults assured,\nAnd brought to medicine a healthful state\nWhich rank of goodness would by ill be cured.\n  But thence I learn and find the lesson true,\n  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.\n\n\n                    119\n\nWhat potions have I drunk of Siren tears\nDistilled from limbecks foul as hell within,\nApplying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,\nStill losing when I saw my self to win!\nWhat wretched errors hath my heart committed,\nWhilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!\nHow have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted\nIn the distraction of this madding fever!\nO benefit of ill, now I find true\nThat better is, by evil still made better.\nAnd ruined love when it is built anew\nGrows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.\n  So I return rebuked to my content,\n  And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.\n\n\n                    120\n\nThat you were once unkind befriends me now,\nAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feel,\nNeeds must I under my transgression bow,\nUnless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.\nFor if you were by my unkindness shaken\nAs I by yours, y\u2019have passed a hell of time,\nAnd I a tyrant have no leisure taken\nTo weigh how once I suffered in your crime.\nO that our night of woe might have remembered\nMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\nAnd soon to you, as you to me then tendered\nThe humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\n  But that your trespass now becomes a fee,\n  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\n\n\n                    121\n\n\u2019Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,\nWhen not to be, receives reproach of being,\nAnd the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,\nNot by our feeling, but by others\u2019 seeing.\nFor why should others\u2019 false adulterate eyes\nGive salutation to my sportive blood?\nOr on my frailties why are frailer spies,\nWhich in their wills count bad what I think good?\nNo, I am that I am, and they that level\nAt my abuses, reckon up their own,\nI may be straight though they themselves be bevel;\nBy their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown\n  Unless this general evil they maintain,\n  All men are bad and in their badness reign.\n\n\n                    122\n\nThy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\nFull charactered with lasting memory,\nWhich shall above that idle rank remain\nBeyond all date even to eternity.\nOr at the least, so long as brain and heart\nHave faculty by nature to subsist,\nTill each to razed oblivion yield his part\nOf thee, thy record never can be missed:\nThat poor retention could not so much hold,\nNor need I tallies thy dear love to score,\nTherefore to give them from me was I bold,\nTo trust those tables that receive thee more:\n  To keep an adjunct to remember thee\n  Were to import forgetfulness in me.\n\n\n                    123\n\nNo! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,\nThy pyramids built up with newer might\nTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange,\nThey are but dressings of a former sight:\nOur dates are brief, and therefore we admire,\nWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old,\nAnd rather make them born to our desire,\nThan think that we before have heard them told:\nThy registers and thee I both defy,\nNot wond\u2019ring at the present, nor the past,\nFor thy records, and what we see doth lie,\nMade more or less by thy continual haste:\n  This I do vow and this shall ever be,\n  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\n\n\n                    124\n\nIf my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune\u2019s bastard be unfathered,\nAs subject to time\u2019s love or to time\u2019s hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.\nNo it was builded far from accident,\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th\u2019 inviting time our fashion calls:\nIt fears not policy that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-numbered hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.\n  To this I witness call the fools of time,\n  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\n\n\n                    125\n\nWere\u2019t aught to me I bore the canopy,\nWith my extern the outward honouring,\nOr laid great bases for eternity,\nWhich proves more short than waste or ruining?\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favour\nLose all, and more by paying too much rent\nFor compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,\nPitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?\nNo, let me be obsequious in thy heart,\nAnd take thou my oblation, poor but free,\nWhich is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,\nBut mutual render, only me for thee.\n  Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul\n  When most impeached, stands least in thy control.\n\n\n                    126\n\nO thou my lovely boy who in thy power,\nDost hold Time\u2019s fickle glass his fickle hour:\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show\u2019st,\nThy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow\u2019st.\nIf Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)\nAs thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\nShe keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\nMay time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.\nYet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,\nShe may detain, but not still keep her treasure!\n  Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,\n  And her quietus is to render thee.\n\n\n                    127\n\nIn the old age black was not counted fair,\nOr if it were it bore not beauty\u2019s name:\nBut now is black beauty\u2019s successive heir,\nAnd beauty slandered with a bastard shame,\nFor since each hand hath put on nature\u2019s power,\nFairing the foul with art\u2019s false borrowed face,\nSweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,\nBut is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.\nTherefore my mistress\u2019 eyes are raven black,\nHer eyes so suited, and they mourners seem\nAt such who not born fair no beauty lack,\nSlandering creation with a false esteem,\n  Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\n  That every tongue says beauty should look so.\n\n\n                    128\n\nHow oft when thou, my music, music play\u2019st,\nUpon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\nWith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway\u2019st\nThe wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\nDo I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\nTo kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\nWhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\nAt the wood\u2019s boldness by thee blushing stand.\nTo be so tickled they would change their state\nAnd situation with those dancing chips,\nO\u2019er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\nMaking dead wood more blest than living lips,\n  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,\n  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\n\n\n                    129\n\nTh\u2019 expense of spirit in a waste of shame\nIs lust in action, and till action, lust\nIs perjured, murd\u2019rous, bloody full of blame,\nSavage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,\nEnjoyed no sooner but despised straight,\nPast reason hunted, and no sooner had\nPast reason hated as a swallowed bait,\nOn purpose laid to make the taker mad.\nMad in pursuit and in possession so,\nHad, having, and in quest, to have extreme,\nA bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;\nBefore a joy proposed behind a dream.\n  All this the world well knows yet none knows well,\n  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\n\n\n                    130\n\nMy mistress\u2019 eyes are nothing like the sun,\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red,\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white,\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks,\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight,\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know,\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\nI grant I never saw a goddess go;\nMy mistress when she walks treads on the ground.\n  And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,\n  As any she belied with false compare.\n\n\n                    131\n\nThou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\nAs those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\nFor well thou know\u2019st to my dear doting heart\nThou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\nYet in good faith some say that thee behold,\nThy face hath not the power to make love groan;\nTo say they err, I dare not be so bold,\nAlthough I swear it to my self alone.\nAnd to be sure that is not false I swear,\nA thousand groans but thinking on thy face,\nOne on another\u2019s neck do witness bear\nThy black is fairest in my judgement\u2019s place.\n  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\n  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.\n\n\n                    132\n\nThine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,\nKnowing thy heart torment me with disdain,\nHave put on black, and loving mourners be,\nLooking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\nAnd truly not the morning sun of heaven\nBetter becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\nNor that full star that ushers in the even\nDoth half that glory to the sober west\nAs those two mourning eyes become thy face:\nO let it then as well beseem thy heart\nTo mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\nAnd suit thy pity like in every part.\n  Then will I swear beauty herself is black,\n  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.\n\n\n                    133\n\nBeshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan\nFor that deep wound it gives my friend and me;\nIs\u2019t not enough to torture me alone,\nBut slave to slavery my sweet\u2019st friend must be?\nMe from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,\nAnd my next self thou harder hast engrossed,\nOf him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,\nA torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:\nPrison my heart in thy steel bosom\u2019s ward,\nBut then my friend\u2019s heart let my poor heart bail,\nWhoe\u2019er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,\nThou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.\n  And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,\n  Perforce am thine and all that is in me.\n\n\n                    134\n\nSo now I have confessed that he is thine,\nAnd I my self am mortgaged to thy will,\nMy self I\u2019ll forfeit, so that other mine,\nThou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\nBut thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\nFor thou art covetous, and he is kind,\nHe learned but surety-like to write for me,\nUnder that bond that him as fist doth bind.\nThe statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\nThou usurer that put\u2019st forth all to use,\nAnd sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,\nSo him I lose through my unkind abuse.\n  Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,\n  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\n\n\n                    135\n\nWhoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,\nAnd Will to boot, and Will in overplus,\nMore than enough am I that vex thee still,\nTo thy sweet will making addition thus.\nWilt thou whose will is large and spacious,\nNot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\nShall will in others seem right gracious,\nAnd in my will no fair acceptance shine?\nThe sea all water, yet receives rain still,\nAnd in abundance addeth to his store,\nSo thou being rich in will add to thy will\nOne will of mine to make thy large will more.\n  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,\n  Think all but one, and me in that one Will.\n\n\n                    136\n\nIf thy soul check thee that I come so near,\nSwear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,\nAnd will thy soul knows is admitted there,\nThus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.\nWill will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\nAy, fill it full with wills, and my will one,\nIn things of great receipt with case we prove,\nAmong a number one is reckoned none.\nThen in the number let me pass untold,\nThough in thy store\u2019s account I one must be,\nFor nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,\nThat nothing me, a something sweet to thee.\n  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,\n  And then thou lov\u2019st me for my name is Will.\n\n\n                    137\n\nThou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\nThat they behold and see not what they see?\nThey know what beauty is, see where it lies,\nYet what the best is, take the worst to be.\nIf eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,\nBe anchored in the bay where all men ride,\nWhy of eyes\u2019 falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\nWhereto the judgement of my heart is tied?\nWhy should my heart think that a several plot,\nWhich my heart knows the wide world\u2019s common place?\nOr mine eyes seeing this, say this is not\nTo put fair truth upon so foul a face?\n  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,\n  And to this false plague are they now transferred.\n\n\n                    138\n\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth,\nI do believe, her though I know she lies,\nThat she might think me some untutored youth,\nUnlearned in the world\u2019s false subtleties.\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\nAlthough she knows my days are past the best,\nSimply I credit her false-speaking tongue;\nOn both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.\nBut wherefore says she not she is unjust?\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\nO love\u2019s best habit is in seeming trust,\nAnd age in love loves not to have years told.\n  Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,\n  And in our faults by lies we flattered be.\n\n\n                    139\n\nO call not me to justify the wrong,\nThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart,\nWound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,\nUse power with power, and slay me not by art,\nTell me thou lov\u2019st elsewhere; but in my sight,\nDear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,\nWhat need\u2019st thou wound with cunning when thy might\nIs more than my o\u2019erpressed defence can bide?\nLet me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,\nHer pretty looks have been mine enemies,\nAnd therefore from my face she turns my foes,\nThat they elsewhere might dart their injuries:\n  Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,\n  Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.\n\n\n                    140\n\nBe wise as thou art cruel, do not press\nMy tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:\nLest sorrow lend me words and words express,\nThe manner of my pity-wanting pain.\nIf I might teach thee wit better it were,\nThough not to love, yet love to tell me so,\nAs testy sick men when their deaths be near,\nNo news but health from their physicians know.\nFor if I should despair I should grow mad,\nAnd in my madness might speak ill of thee,\nNow this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,\nMad slanderers by mad ears believed be.\n  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,\n  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.\n\n\n                    141\n\nIn faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,\nFor they in thee a thousand errors note,\nBut \u2019tis my heart that loves what they despise,\nWho in despite of view is pleased to dote.\nNor are mine ears with thy tongue\u2019s tune delighted,\nNor tender feeling to base touches prone,\nNor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\nTo any sensual feast with thee alone:\nBut my five wits, nor my five senses can\nDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\nWho leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\nThy proud heart\u2019s slave and vassal wretch to be:\n  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,\n  That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.\n\n\n                    142\n\nLove is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,\nHate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,\nO but with mine, compare thou thine own state,\nAnd thou shalt find it merits not reproving,\nOr if it do, not from those lips of thine,\nThat have profaned their scarlet ornaments,\nAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,\nRobbed others\u2019 beds\u2019 revenues of their rents.\nBe it lawful I love thee as thou lov\u2019st those,\nWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,\nRoot pity in thy heart that when it grows,\nThy pity may deserve to pitied be.\n  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,\n  By self-example mayst thou be denied.\n\n\n                    143\n\nLo as a careful huswife runs to catch,\nOne of her feathered creatures broke away,\nSets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch\nIn pursuit of the thing she would have stay:\nWhilst her neglected child holds her in chase,\nCries to catch her whose busy care is bent,\nTo follow that which flies before her face:\nNot prizing her poor infant\u2019s discontent;\nSo run\u2019st thou after that which flies from thee,\nWhilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,\nBut if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:\nAnd play the mother\u2019s part, kiss me, be kind.\n  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,\n  If thou turn back and my loud crying still.\n\n\n                    144\n\nTwo loves I have, of comfort and despair,\nWhich, like two spirits, do suggest me still:\nThe better angel is a man right fair,\nThe worser spirit a woman coloured ill.\nTo win me soon to hell my female evil\nTempteth my better angel from my side,\nAnd would corrupt my saint to be a devil,\nWooing his purity with her foul pride.\nAnd whether that my angel be turned fiend\nSuspect I may, yet not directly tell;\nBut being both from me both to each friend,\nI guess one angel in another\u2019s hell.\n  Yet this shall I ne\u2019er know, but live in doubt,\n  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.\n\n\n                    145\n\nThose lips that Love\u2019s own hand did make,\nBreathed forth the sound that said \u2018I hate\u2019,\nTo me that languished for her sake:\nBut when she saw my woeful state,\nStraight in her heart did mercy come,\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet,\nWas used in giving gentle doom:\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet:\n\u2018I hate\u2019 she altered with an end,\nThat followed it as gentle day,\nDoth follow night who like a fiend\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away.\n  \u2018I hate\u2019, from hate away she threw,\n  And saved my life saying \u2018not you\u2019.\n\n\n                    146\n\nPoor soul the centre of my sinful earth,\nMy sinful earth these rebel powers array,\nWhy dost thou pine within and suffer dearth\nPainting thy outward walls so costly gay?\nWhy so large cost having so short a lease,\nDost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\nShall worms inheritors of this excess\nEat up thy charge? is this thy body\u2019s end?\nThen soul live thou upon thy servant\u2019s loss,\nAnd let that pine to aggravate thy store;\nBuy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\nWithin be fed, without be rich no more,\n  So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,\n  And death once dead, there\u2019s no more dying then.\n\n\n                    147\n\nMy love is as a fever longing still,\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nTh\u2019 uncertain sickly appetite to please:\nMy reason the physician to my love,\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve,\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest,\nMy thoughts and my discourse as mad men\u2019s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed.\n  For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\n  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.\n\n\n                    148\n\nO me! what eyes hath love put in my head,\nWhich have no correspondence with true sight,\nOr if they have, where is my judgement fled,\nThat censures falsely what they see aright?\nIf that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,\nWhat means the world to say it is not so?\nIf it be not, then love doth well denote,\nLove\u2019s eye is not so true as all men\u2019s: no,\nHow can it? O how can love\u2019s eye be true,\nThat is so vexed with watching and with tears?\nNo marvel then though I mistake my view,\nThe sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.\n  O cunning love, with tears thou keep\u2019st me blind,\n  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.\n\n\n                    149\n\nCanst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,\nWhen I against my self with thee partake?\nDo I not think on thee when I forgot\nAm of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?\nWho hateth thee that I do call my friend,\nOn whom frown\u2019st thou that I do fawn upon,\nNay if thou lour\u2019st on me do I not spend\nRevenge upon my self with present moan?\nWhat merit do I in my self respect,\nThat is so proud thy service to despise,\nWhen all my best doth worship thy defect,\nCommanded by the motion of thine eyes?\n  But love hate on for now I know thy mind,\n  Those that can see thou lov\u2019st, and I am blind.\n\n\n                    150\n\nO from what power hast thou this powerful might,\nWith insufficiency my heart to sway,\nTo make me give the lie to my true sight,\nAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?\nWhence hast thou this becoming of things ill,\nThat in the very refuse of thy deeds,\nThere is such strength and warrantise of skill,\nThat in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?\nWho taught thee how to make me love thee more,\nThe more I hear and see just cause of hate?\nO though I love what others do abhor,\nWith others thou shouldst not abhor my state.\n  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,\n  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.\n\n\n                    151\n\nLove is too young to know what conscience is,\nYet who knows not conscience is born of love?\nThen gentle cheater urge not my amiss,\nLest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.\nFor thou betraying me, I do betray\nMy nobler part to my gross body\u2019s treason,\nMy soul doth tell my body that he may,\nTriumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,\nBut rising at thy name doth point out thee,\nAs his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,\nHe is contented thy poor drudge to be,\nTo stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\n  No want of conscience hold it that I call,\n  Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.\n\n\n                    152\n\nIn loving thee thou know\u2019st I am forsworn,\nBut thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,\nIn act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,\nIn vowing new hate after new love bearing:\nBut why of two oaths\u2019 breach do I accuse thee,\nWhen I break twenty? I am perjured most,\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost.\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,\nAnd to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,\nOr made them swear against the thing they see.\n  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,\n  To swear against the truth so foul a lie.\n\n\n                    153\n\nCupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,\nA maid of Dian\u2019s this advantage found,\nAnd his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\nIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground:\nWhich borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\nA dateless lively heat still to endure,\nAnd grew a seething bath which yet men prove,\nAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure:\nBut at my mistress\u2019 eye Love\u2019s brand new-fired,\nThe boy for trial needs would touch my breast,\nI sick withal the help of bath desired,\nAnd thither hied a sad distempered guest.\n  But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,\n  Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n                    154\n\nThe little Love-god lying once asleep,\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,\nCame tripping by, but in her maiden hand,\nThe fairest votary took up that fire,\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed,\nAnd so the general of hot desire,\nWas sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from Love\u2019s fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\nFor men diseased; but I, my mistress\u2019 thrall,\n  Came there for cure and this by that I prove,\n  Love\u2019s fire heats water, water cools not love.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\nALL\u2019S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\n\n\n\nContents\n\nACT I\nScene I.

Rossillon. A room in the Countess\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in\n black.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o\u2019er my father\u2019s death anew; but I must\nattend his majesty\u2019s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in\nsubjection.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He\nthat so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his\nvirtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,\nrather than lack it where there is such abundance.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat hope is there of his majesty\u2019s amendment?\n\nLAFEW.\nHe hath abandon\u2019d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath\npersecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process\nbut only the losing of hope by time.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis young gentlewoman had a father\u2014O that \u201chad!\u201d, how sad a passage\n\u2019tis!\u2014whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch\u2019d\nso far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for\nlack of work. Would for the king\u2019s sake he were living! I think it\nwould be the death of the king\u2019s disease.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be\nso: Gerard de Narbon.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him\nadmiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv\u2019d still,\nif knowledge could be set up against mortality.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\n\nLAFEW.\nA fistula, my lord.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI heard not of it before.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of\nGerard de Narbon?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those\nhopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind\ncarries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are\nvirtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\u2019Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance\nof her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows\ntakes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no\nmore, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.\n\nHELENA.\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\n\nLAFEW.\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the\nenemy to the living.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow understand we that?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\nIn manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\nDo wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy\nRather in power than use; and keep thy friend\nUnder thy own life\u2019s key. Be check\u2019d for silence,\nBut never tax\u2019d for speech. What heaven more will,\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\nFall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,\n\u2019Tis an unseason\u2019d courtier; good my lord,\nAdvise him.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe cannot want the best\nThat shall attend his love.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\n\n [_Exit Countess._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nThe best wishes that can be forg\u2019d in your thoughts be servants to you!\n[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make\nmuch of her.\n\nLAFEW.\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]\n\nHELENA.\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\nI have forgot him; my imagination\nCarries no favour in\u2019t but Bertram\u2019s.\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\nIf Bertram be away. \u2019Twere all one\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\nTh\u2019ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\nMust die for love. \u2019Twas pretty, though a plague,\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\nIn our heart\u2019s table,\u2014heart too capable\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\nBut now he\u2019s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\nYet these fix\u2019d evils sit so fit in him\nThat they take place when virtue\u2019s steely bones\nLooks bleak i\u2019 th\u2019 cold wind: withal, full oft we see\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSave you, fair queen!\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you, monarch!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNo.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd no.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAre you meditating on virginity?\n\nHELENA.\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.\nMan is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\n\nPAROLLES.\nKeep him out.\n\nHELENA.\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet\nis weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow\nyou up.\n\nHELENA.\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no\nmilitary policy how virgins might blow up men?\n\nPAROLLES.\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in\nblowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your\ncity. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve\nvirginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never\nvirgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times\nfound; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. \u2019Tis too cold a companion.\nAway with it!\n\nHELENA.\nI will stand for\u2019t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere\u2019s little can be said in\u2019t; \u2019tis against the rule of nature. To\nspeak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most\ninfallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity\nmurders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\nlimit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\nmites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\ndies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\nproud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by\u2019t. Out with\u2019t! Within\nthe year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the\nprincipal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\n\nHELENA.\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n\nPAROLLES.\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne\u2019er it likes. \u2019Tis a\ncommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less\nworth. Off with\u2019t while \u2019tis vendible; answer the time of request.\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly\nsuited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which\nwear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in\nyour cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our\nFrench wither\u2019d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, \u2019tis a\nwither\u2019d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet \u2019tis a wither\u2019d pear.\nWill you anything with it?\n\nHELENA.\nNot my virginity yet.\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he\u2014\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\nThe court\u2019s a learning-place; and he is one.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat one, i\u2019 faith?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I wish well. \u2019Tis pity\u2014\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat\u2019s pity?\n\nHELENA.\nThat wishing well had not a body in\u2019t\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\nReturns us thanks.\n\n Enter a Page.\n\nPAGE.\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\n\n [_Exit Page._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at\ncourt.\n\nHELENA.\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUnder Mars, I.\n\nHELENA.\nI especially think, under Mars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy under Mars?\n\nHELENA.\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under\nMars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhen he was predominant.\n\nHELENA.\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy think you so?\n\nHELENA.\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat\u2019s for advantage.\n\nHELENA.\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition\nthat your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and\nI like the wear well.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return\nperfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier\u2019s counsel, and understand\nwhat advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine\nunthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy\nfriends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So,\nfarewell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nHELENA.\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\nThe king\u2019s disease,\u2014my project may deceive me,\nBut my intents are fix\u2019d, and will not leave me.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Paris. A room in the King\u2019s palace.\n\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and\n others attending.\n\nKING.\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th\u2019 ears;\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\nA braving war.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSo \u2019tis reported, sir.\n\nKING.\nNay, \u2019tis most credible, we here receive it,\nA certainty, vouch\u2019d from our cousin Austria,\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\nTo have us make denial.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHis love and wisdom,\nApprov\u2019d so to your majesty, may plead\nFor amplest credence.\n\nKING.\nHe hath arm\u2019d our answer,\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\nTo stand on either part.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt well may serve\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\nFor breathing and exploit.\n\nKING.\nWhat\u2019s he comes here?\n\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\nYoung Bertram.\n\nKING.\nYouth, thou bear\u2019st thy father\u2019s face;\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\nHath well compos\u2019d thee. Thy father\u2019s moral parts\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty\u2019s.\n\nKING.\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\nInto the service of the time, and was\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\nHis equal had awak\u2019d them, and his honour,\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\nException bid him speak, and at this time\nHis tongue obey\u2019d his hand. Who were below him\nHe us\u2019d as creatures of another place,\nAnd bow\u2019d his eminent top to their low ranks,\nMaking them proud of his humility,\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\nBut goers backward.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHis good remembrance, sir,\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\nAs in your royal speech.\n\nKING.\nWould I were with him! He would always say,\u2014\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\nHe scatter\u2019d not in ears, but grafted them\nTo grow there and to bear,\u2014\u201cLet me not live,\u201d\nThis his good melancholy oft began\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\nWhen it was out,\u2014\u201cLet me not live\u201d quoth he,\n\u201cAfter my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\nExpire before their fashions.\u201d This he wish\u2019d.\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\nTo give some labourers room.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou\u2019re lov\u2019d, sir;\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\n\nKING.\nI fill a place, I know\u2019t. How long is\u2019t, Count,\nSince the physician at your father\u2019s died?\nHe was much fam\u2019d.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSome six months since, my lord.\n\nKING.\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;\u2014\nLend me an arm;\u2014the rest have worn me out\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\nMy son\u2019s no dearer.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThank your majesty.\n\n [_Exeunt. Flourish._]\n\nSCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found\nin the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty,\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\npublish them.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have\nheard of you I do not all believe; \u2019tis my slowness that I do not; for\nI know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to\nmake such knaveries yours.\n\nCLOWN.\n\u2019Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, sir.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, madam, \u2019tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are\ndamned; but if I may have your ladyship\u2019s good will to go to the world,\nIsbel the woman and I will do as we may.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\n\nCLOWN.\nI do beg your good will in this case.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn what case?\n\nCLOWN.\nIn Isbel\u2019s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I\nshall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for\nthey say barnes are blessings.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\n\nCLOWN.\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he\nmust needs go that the devil drives.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIs this all your worship\u2019s reason?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMay the world know them?\n\nCLOWN.\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood\nare; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife\u2019s\nsake.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nY\u2019are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that\nfor me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and\ngives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he\u2019s my drudge. He\nthat comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that\ncherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\nflesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my\nfriend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no\nfear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the\npapist, howsome\u2019er their hearts are sever\u2019d in religion, their heads\nare both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i\u2019 the herd.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth\u2019d and calumnious knave?\n\nCLOWN.\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\n   _For I the ballad will repeat,\n   Which men full true shall find;\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGet you gone, sir; I\u2019ll talk with you more anon.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to\nspeak.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._]\n_   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\n   Fond done, done fond,\n      Was this King Priam\u2019s joy?\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n      And gave this sentence then:\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n     There\u2019s yet one good in ten._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\n\nCLOWN.\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o\u2019 the song. Would\nGod would serve the world so all the year! We\u2019d find no fault with the\ntithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth \u2019a! And we might\nhave a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake,\n\u2019twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he\npluck one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou\u2019ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\n\nCLOWN.\nThat man should be at woman\u2019s command, and yet no hurt done! Though\nhonesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the\nsurplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,\nforsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, now.\n\nSTEWARD.\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath\u2019d her to me, and she herself, without\nother advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds;\nthere is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than\nshe\u2019ll demand.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish\u2019d me; alone\nshe was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;\nshe thought, I dare vow for her, they touch\u2019d not any stranger sense.\nHer matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess,\nthat had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god,\nthat would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana\nno queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris\u2019d,\nwithout rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she\ndeliver\u2019d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e\u2019er I heard virgin\nexclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to\nknow it.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou have discharg\u2019d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many\nlikelihoods inform\u2019d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the\nbalance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me;\nstall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will\nspeak with you further anon.\n\n [_Exit Steward._]\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\nIf ever we are nature\u2019s, these are ours; this thorn\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\nIt is the show and seal of nature\u2019s truth,\nWhere love\u2019s strong passion is impress\u2019d in youth.\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\nHer eye is sick on\u2019t; I observe her now.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou know, Helen,\nI am a mother to you.\n\nHELENA.\nMine honourable mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNay, a mother.\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\nMethought you saw a serpent. What\u2019s in mother,\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\nThat were enwombed mine. \u2019Tis often seen\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\nYou ne\u2019er oppress\u2019d me with a mother\u2019s groan,\nYet I express to you a mother\u2019s care.\nGod\u2019s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\nTo say I am thy mother? What\u2019s the matter,\nThat this distempered messenger of wet,\nThe many-colour\u2019d Iris, rounds thine eye?\n\u2014Why, that you are my daughter?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I am not.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI say, I am your mother.\n\nHELENA.\nPardon, madam;\nThe Count Rossillon cannot be my brother.\nI am from humble, he from honoured name;\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble,\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die.\nHe must not be my brother.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNor I your mother?\n\nHELENA.\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were\u2014\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,\u2014\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\nSo I were not his sister. Can\u2019t no other,\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\nSo strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?\nMy fear hath catch\u2019d your fondness; now I see\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\nYour salt tears\u2019 head. Now to all sense \u2019tis gross\nYou love my son; invention is asham\u2019d,\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\nBut tell me then, \u2019tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\nConfess it, t\u2019one to th\u2019other; and thine eyes\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is\u2019t so?\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\nIf it be not, forswear\u2019t: howe\u2019er, I charge thee,\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\nTo tell me truly.\n\nHELENA.\nGood madam, pardon me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you love my son?\n\nHELENA.\nYour pardon, noble mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nLove you my son?\n\nHELENA.\nDo not you love him, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGo not about; my love hath in\u2019t a bond\nWhereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\nHave to the full appeach\u2019d.\n\nHELENA.\nThen I confess,\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\nI love your son.\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so\u2019s my love.\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\nThat he is lov\u2019d of me; I follow him not\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\nYet never know how that desert should be.\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\nI still pour in the waters of my love\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\nReligious in mine error, I adore\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHad you not lately an intent,\u2014speak truly,\u2014\nTo go to Paris?\n\nHELENA.\nMadam, I had.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWherefore? tell true.\n\nHELENA.\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\nOf rare and prov\u2019d effects, such as his reading\nAnd manifest experience had collected\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will\u2019d me\nIn heedfull\u2019st reservation to bestow them,\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\nThere is a remedy, approv\u2019d, set down,\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\nThe king is render\u2019d lost.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis was your motive\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\n\nHELENA.\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\nHaply been absent then.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBut think you, Helen,\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\nHe would receive it? He and his physicians\nAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him;\nThey, that they cannot help. How shall they credit\nA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\nEmbowell\u2019d of their doctrine, have let off\nThe danger to itself?\n\nHELENA.\nThere\u2019s something in\u2019t\nMore than my father\u2019s skill, which was the great\u2019st\nOf his profession, that his good receipt\nShall for my legacy be sanctified\nBy th\u2019 luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour\nBut give me leave to try success, I\u2019d venture\nThe well-lost life of mine on his grace\u2019s cure.\nBy such a day, an hour.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDost thou believe\u2019t?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, madam, knowingly.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\nMeans and attendants, and my loving greetings\nTo those of mine in court. I\u2019ll stay at home,\nAnd pray God\u2019s blessing into thy attempt.\nBe gone tomorrow; and be sure of this,\nWhat I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I. Paris. A room in the King\u2019s palace.\n\n Flourish. Enter the King with young Lords taking leave for the\n Florentine war; Bertram, Parolles and Attendants.\n\nKING.\nFarewell, young lords; these warlike principles\nDo not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell;\nShare the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,\nThe gift doth stretch itself as \u2019tis receiv\u2019d,\nAnd is enough for both.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n\u2019Tis our hope, sir,\nAfter well-ent\u2019red soldiers, to return\nAnd find your grace in health.\n\nKING.\nNo, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart\nWill not confess he owes the malady\nThat doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,\u2014\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\nOf the last monarchy\u2014see that you come\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\n\nKING.\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\nThey say our French lack language to deny\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\nBefore you serve.\n\nBOTH.\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\n\nKING.\nFarewell.\u2014Come hither to me.\n\n [_The King retires to a couch._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\n\nPAROLLES.\n\u2019Tis not his fault; the spark.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, \u2019tis brave wars!\n\nPAROLLES.\nMost admirable! I have seen those wars.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI am commanded here, and kept a coil with,\n\u201cToo young\u201d, and \u201cthe next year\u201d and \u201c\u2019tis too early\u201d.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAn thy mind stand to\u2019t, boy, steal away bravely.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,\nCreaking my shoes on the plain masonry,\nTill honour be bought up, and no sword worn\nBut one to dance with. By heaven, I\u2019ll steal away.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThere\u2019s honour in the theft.\n\nPAROLLES.\nCommit it, count.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI am your accessary; and so farewell.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI grow to you, and our parting is a tortur\u2019d body.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nFarewell, captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nSweet Monsieur Parolles!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNoble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a\nword, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one\nCaptain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his\nsinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench\u2019d it. Say to him I\nlive; and observe his reports for me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWe shall, noble captain.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMars dote on you for his novices!\n\n [_Exeunt Lords._]\n\nWhat will ye do?\n\nBERTRAM.\nStay the king.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUse a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain\u2019d\nyourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to\nthem; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster\ntrue gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most\nreceiv\u2019d star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be\nfollowed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I will do so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWorthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nPardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.\n\nKING.\nI\u2019ll fee thee to stand up.\n\nLAFEW.\nThen here\u2019s a man stands that has brought his pardon.\nI would you had kneel\u2019d, my lord, to ask me mercy,\nAnd that at my bidding you could so stand up.\n\nKING.\nI would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\nAnd ask\u2019d thee mercy for\u2019t.\n\nLAFEW.\nGood faith, across;\nBut, my good lord, \u2019tis thus: will you be cur\u2019d\nOf your infirmity?\n\nKING.\nNo.\n\nLAFEW.\nO, will you eat\nNo grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will\nMy noble grapes, and if my royal fox\nCould reach them. I have seen a medicine\nThat\u2019s able to breathe life into a stone,\nQuicken a rock, and make you dance canary\nWith sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch\nIs powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,\nTo give great Charlemain a pen in\u2019s hand\nAnd write to her a love-line.\n\nKING.\nWhat \u2018her\u2019 is this?\n\nLAFEW.\nWhy, doctor \u2018she\u2019! My lord, there\u2019s one arriv\u2019d,\nIf you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,\nIf seriously I may convey my thoughts\nIn this my light deliverance, I have spoke\nWith one that in her sex, her years, profession,\nWisdom, and constancy, hath amaz\u2019d me more\nThan I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,\nFor that is her demand, and know her business?\nThat done, laugh well at me.\n\nKING.\nNow, good Lafew,\nBring in the admiration; that we with thee\nMay spend our wonder too, or take off thine\nBy wond\u2019ring how thou took\u2019st it.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, I\u2019ll fit you,\nAnd not be all day neither.\n\n [_Exit Lafew._]\n\nKING.\nThus he his special nothing ever prologues.\n\n Enter Lafew with Helena.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\n\nKING.\nThis haste hath wings indeed.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\nThis is his majesty, say your mind to him.\nA traitor you do look like, but such traitors\nHis majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid\u2019s uncle,\nThat dare leave two together. Fare you well.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nKING.\nNow, fair one, does your business follow us?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, my good lord.\nGerard de Narbon was my father,\nIn what he did profess, well found.\n\nKING.\nI knew him.\n\nHELENA.\nThe rather will I spare my praises towards him.\nKnowing him is enough. On his bed of death\nMany receipts he gave me; chiefly one,\nWhich, as the dearest issue of his practice,\nAnd of his old experience the only darling,\nHe bade me store up as a triple eye,\nSafer than mine own two; more dear I have so,\nAnd hearing your high majesty is touch\u2019d\nWith that malignant cause, wherein the honour\nOf my dear father\u2019s gift stands chief in power,\nI come to tender it, and my appliance,\nWith all bound humbleness.\n\nKING.\nWe thank you, maiden,\nBut may not be so credulous of cure,\nWhen our most learned doctors leave us, and\nThe congregated college have concluded\nThat labouring art can never ransom nature\nFrom her inaidable estate. I say we must not\nSo stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,\nTo prostitute our past-cure malady\nTo empirics, or to dissever so\nOur great self and our credit, to esteem\nA senseless help, when help past sense we deem.\n\nHELENA.\nMy duty then shall pay me for my pains.\nI will no more enforce mine office on you,\nHumbly entreating from your royal thoughts\nA modest one to bear me back again.\n\nKING.\nI cannot give thee less, to be call\u2019d grateful.\nThou thought\u2019st to help me; and such thanks I give\nAs one near death to those that wish him live.\nBut what at full I know, thou know\u2019st no part;\nI knowing all my peril, thou no art.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat I can do can do no hurt to try,\nSince you set up your rest \u2019gainst remedy.\nHe that of greatest works is finisher\nOft does them by the weakest minister.\nSo holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,\nWhen judges have been babes. Great floods have flown\nFrom simple sources, and great seas have dried\nWhen miracles have by the great\u2019st been denied.\nOft expectation fails, and most oft there\nWhere most it promises; and oft it hits\nWhere hope is coldest, and despair most fits.\n\nKING.\nI must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.\nThy pains, not us\u2019d, must by thyself be paid;\nProffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.\n\nHELENA.\nInspired merit so by breath is barr\u2019d.\nIt is not so with Him that all things knows\nAs \u2019tis with us that square our guess by shows;\nBut most it is presumption in us when\nThe help of heaven we count the act of men.\nDear sir, to my endeavours give consent;\nOf heaven, not me, make an experiment.\nI am not an impostor, that proclaim\nMyself against the level of mine aim,\nBut know I think, and think I know most sure,\nMy art is not past power nor you past cure.\n\nKING.\nArt thou so confident? Within what space\nHop\u2019st thou my cure?\n\nHELENA.\nThe greatest grace lending grace.\nEre twice the horses of the sun shall bring\nTheir fiery torcher his diurnal ring,\nEre twice in murk and occidental damp\nMoist Hesperus hath quench\u2019d her sleepy lamp;\nOr four and twenty times the pilot\u2019s glass\nHath told the thievish minutes how they pass;\nWhat is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,\nHealth shall live free, and sickness freely die.\n\nKING.\nUpon thy certainty and confidence\nWhat dar\u2019st thou venture?\n\nHELENA.\nTax of impudence,\nA strumpet\u2019s boldness, a divulged shame,\nTraduc\u2019d by odious ballads; my maiden\u2019s name\nSear\u2019d otherwise; nay worse of worst extended\nWith vilest torture, let my life be ended.\n\nKING.\nMethinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak\nHis powerful sound within an organ weak;\nAnd what impossibility would slay\nIn common sense, sense saves another way.\nThy life is dear, for all that life can rate\nWorth name of life in thee hath estimate:\nYouth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all\nThat happiness and prime can happy call.\nThou this to hazard needs must intimate\nSkill infinite, or monstrous desperate.\nSweet practiser, thy physic I will try,\nThat ministers thine own death if I die.\n\nHELENA.\nIf I break time, or flinch in property\nOf what I spoke, unpitied let me die,\nAnd well deserv\u2019d. Not helping, death\u2019s my fee;\nBut if I help, what do you promise me?\n\nKING.\nMake thy demand.\n\nHELENA.\nBut will you make it even?\n\nKING.\nAy, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.\n\nHELENA.\nThen shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand\nWhat husband in thy power I will command:\nExempted be from me the arrogance\nTo choose from forth the royal blood of France,\nMy low and humble name to propagate\nWith any branch or image of thy state;\nBut such a one, thy vassal, whom I know\nIs free for me to ask, thee to bestow.\n\nKING.\nHere is my hand; the premises observ\u2019d,\nThy will by my performance shall be serv\u2019d;\nSo make the choice of thy own time, for I,\nThy resolv\u2019d patient, on thee still rely.\nMore should I question thee, and more I must,\nThough more to know could not be more to trust:\nFrom whence thou cam\u2019st, how tended on; but rest\nUnquestion\u2019d welcome, and undoubted bless\u2019d.\nGive me some help here, ho! If thou proceed\nAs high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rossillon.

I know my business is\nbut to the court.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that\nwith such contempt? But to the court!\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it\noff at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off\u2019s cap, kiss his hand,\nand say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such\na fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have\nan answer will serve all men.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMarry, that\u2019s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\n\nCLOWN.\nIt is like a barber\u2019s chair, that fits all buttocks\u2014the pin-buttock,\nthe quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWill your answer serve fit to all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French\ncrown for your taffety punk, as Tib\u2019s rush for Tom\u2019s forefinger, as a\npancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his\nhole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling\nknave, as the nun\u2019s lip to the friar\u2019s mouth; nay, as the pudding to\nhis skin.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any\nquestion.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth\nof it. Here it is, and all that belongs to\u2019t. Ask me if I am a\ncourtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to\nbe the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! There\u2019s a simple putting off.

Nay, put me to\u2019t, I warrant you.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou were lately whipp\u2019d, sir, as I think.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Spare not me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you cry \u2018O Lord, sir!\u2019 at your whipping, and \u2018spare not me\u2019? Indeed\nyour \u2018O Lord, sir!\u2019 is very sequent to your whipping.

Thy frank election make;\nThou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.\n\nHELENA.\nTo each of you one fair and virtuous mistress\nFall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!\n\nLAFEW.\nI\u2019d give bay curtal and his furniture\nMy mouth no more were broken than these boys\u2019,\nAnd writ as little beard.\n\nKING.\nPeruse them well.\nNot one of those but had a noble father.\n\n She addresses her to a Lord.\n\nHELENA.\nGentlemen,\nHeaven hath through me restor\u2019d the king to health.\n\nALL.\nWe understand it, and thank heaven for you.\n\nHELENA.\nI am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest\nThat I protest I simply am a maid.\nPlease it, your majesty, I have done already.\nThe blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:\n\u201cWe blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,\nLet the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,\nWe\u2019ll ne\u2019er come there again.\u201d\n\nKING.\nMake choice; and, see,\nWho shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.\n\nHELENA.\nNow, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,\nAnd to imperial Love, that god most high,\nDo my sighs stream. [_To first Lord._] Sir, will you hear my suit?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAnd grant it.\n\nHELENA.\nThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\n\nLAFEW.\nI had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To second Lord._] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\nBefore I speak, too threat\u2019ningly replies.\nLove make your fortunes twenty times above\nHer that so wishes, and her humble love!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNo better, if you please.\n\nHELENA.\nMy wish receive,\nWhich great Love grant; and so I take my leave.\n\nLAFEW.\nDo all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I\u2019d have them whipp\u2019d;\nor I would send them to th\u2019 Turk to make eunuchs of.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To third Lord._] Be not afraid that I your hand should take;\nI\u2019ll never do you wrong for your own sake.\nBlessing upon your vows, and in your bed\nFind fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\n\nLAFEW.\nThese boys are boys of ice, they\u2019ll none have her. Sure, they are\nbastards to the English; the French ne\u2019er got \u2019em.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To fourth Lord._] You are too young, too happy, and too good,\nTo make yourself a son out of my blood.\n\nFOURTH LORD.\nFair one, I think not so.\n\nLAFEW.\nThere\u2019s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou\nbeest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To Bertram._] I dare not say I take you, but I give\nMe and my service, ever whilst I live,\nInto your guiding power. This is the man.\n\nKING.\nWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she\u2019s thy wife.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\nIn such a business give me leave to use\nThe help of mine own eyes.\n\nKING.\nKnow\u2019st thou not, Bertram,\nWhat she has done for me?\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, my good lord,\nBut never hope to know why I should marry her.\n\nKING.\nThou know\u2019st she has rais\u2019d me from my sickly bed.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut follows it, my lord, to bring me down\nMust answer for your raising? I know her well;\nShe had her breeding at my father\u2019s charge:\nA poor physician\u2019s daughter my wife! Disdain\nRather corrupt me ever!\n\nKING.\n\u2019Tis only title thou disdain\u2019st in her, the which\nI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\nOf colour, weight, and heat, pour\u2019d all together,\nWould quite confound distinction, yet stands off\nIn differences so mighty. If she be\nAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislik\u2019st,\nA poor physician\u2019s daughter,\u2014thou dislik\u2019st\u2014\nOf virtue for the name. But do not so.\nFrom lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\nThe place is dignified by the doer\u2019s deed.\nWhere great additions swell\u2019s, and virtue none,\nIt is a dropsied honour. Good alone\nIs good without a name; vileness is so:\nThe property by what it is should go,\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\nIn these to nature she\u2019s immediate heir;\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour\u2019s scorn\nWhich challenges itself as honour\u2019s born,\nAnd is not like the sire. Honours thrive\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\nThan our fore-goers. The mere word\u2019s a slave,\nDebauch\u2019d on every tomb, on every grave\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\nWhere dust and damn\u2019d oblivion is the tomb\nOf honour\u2019d bones indeed. What should be said?\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\nI can create the rest. Virtue and she\nIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI cannot love her, nor will strive to do \u2019t.\n\nKING.\nThou wrong\u2019st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\n\nHELENA.\nThat you are well restor\u2019d, my lord, I am glad.\nLet the rest go.\n\nKING.\nMy honour\u2019s at the stake, which to defeat,\nI must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\nWe please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;\nObey our will, which travails in thy good;\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\nLoosing upon thee in the name of justice,\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!\n\nBERTRAM.\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\nMy fancy to your eyes. When I consider\nWhat great creation, and what dole of honour\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\nIs as \u2019twere born so.\n\nKING.\nTake her by the hand,\nAnd tell her she is thine; to whom I promise\nA counterpoise; if not to thy estate,\nA balance more replete.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI take her hand.\n\nKING.\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\nAnd be perform\u2019d tonight. The solemn feast\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lov\u2019st her,\nThy love\u2019s to me religious; else, does err.\n\n [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]\n\nLAFEW.\nDo you hear, monsieur? A word with you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYour pleasure, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour lord and master did well to make his recantation.\n\nPAROLLES.\nRecantation! My lord! My master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAy. Is it not a language I speak?\n\nPAROLLES.\nA most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.\nMy master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAre you companion to the Count Rossillon?\n\nPAROLLES.\nTo any count; to all counts; to what is man.\n\nLAFEW.\nTo what is count\u2019s man: count\u2019s master is of another style.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYou are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.\n\nLAFEW.\nI must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring\nthee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat I dare too well do, I dare not do.\n\nLAFEW.\nI did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou\ndidst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs\nand the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing\nthee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose\nthee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and\nthat thou art scarce worth.\n\nPAROLLES.\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee\u2014\n\nLAFEW.\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial;\nwhich if\u2014Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of\nlattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look\nthrough thee. Give me thy hand.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you give me most egregious indignity.\n\nLAFEW.\nAy, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI have not, my lord, deserv\u2019d it.\n\nLAFEW.\nYes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, I shall be wiser.\n\nLAFEW.\nEv\u2019n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o\u2019 th\u2019\ncontrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt\nfind what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my\nacquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the\ndefault, \u201cHe is a man I know.\u201d\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for\ndoing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me\nleave.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old,\nfilthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of\nauthority. I\u2019ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any\nconvenience, an he were double and double a lord. I\u2019ll have no more\npity of his age than I would have of\u2014I\u2019ll beat him, and if I could but\nmeet him again.\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nSirrah, your lord and master\u2019s married; there\u2019s news for you; you have\na new mistress.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of\nyour wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho? God?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nThe devil it is that\u2019s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o\u2019\nthis fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou\nwert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if\nI were but two hours younger, I\u2019d beat thee. Methink\u2019st thou art a\ngeneral offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast\ncreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a\npomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more\nsaucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your\nbirth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word,\nelse I\u2019d call you knave. I leave you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nPAROLLES.\nGood, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal\u2019d\nawhile.\n\nBERTRAM.\nUndone, and forfeited to cares for ever!\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat\u2019s the matter, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAlthough before the solemn priest I have sworn,\nI will not bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat, what, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nO my Parolles, they have married me!\nI\u2019ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nFrance is a dog-hole, and it no more merits\nThe tread of a man\u2019s foot: to the wars!\n\nBERTRAM.\nThere\u2019s letters from my mother; what th\u2019 import is\nI know not yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, that would be known. To th\u2019 wars, my boy, to th\u2019 wars!\nHe wears his honour in a box unseen\nThat hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,\nSpending his manly marrow in her arms,\nWhich should sustain the bound and high curvet\nOf Mars\u2019s fiery steed. To other regions!\nFrance is a stable; we that dwell in\u2019t, jades,\nTherefore, to th\u2019 war!\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt shall be so; I\u2019ll send her to my house,\nAcquaint my mother with my hate to her,\nAnd wherefore I am fled; write to the king\nThat which I durst not speak. His present gift\nShall furnish me to those Italian fields\nWhere noble fellows strike. War is no strife\nTo the dark house and the detested wife.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWill this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGo with me to my chamber and advise me.\nI\u2019ll send her straight away. Tomorrow\nI\u2019ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, these balls bound; there\u2019s noise in it. \u2019Tis hard:\nA young man married is a man that\u2019s marr\u2019d.\nTherefore away, and leave her bravely; go.\nThe king has done you wrong; but hush \u2019tis so.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Paris. The King\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Helena and Clown.\n\nHELENA.\nMy mother greets me kindly: is she well?\n\nCLOWN.\nShe is not well, but yet she has her health; she\u2019s very merry, but yet\nshe is not well. But thanks be given, she\u2019s very well, and wants\nnothing i\u2019 the world; but yet she is not well.\n\nHELENA.\nIf she be very well, what does she ail that she\u2019s not very well?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, she\u2019s very well indeed, but for two things.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat two things?\n\nCLOWN.\nOne, that she\u2019s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other,\nthat she\u2019s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBless you, my fortunate lady!\n\nHELENA.\nI hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYou had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them\nstill. O, my knave how does my old lady?\n\nCLOWN.\nSo that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you\nsay.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, I say nothing.\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, you are the wiser man; for many a man\u2019s tongue shakes out his\nmaster\u2019s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and\nto have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a\nvery little of nothing.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAway! Thou art a knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is\nbefore me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.\n\nPAROLLES.\nGo to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nDid you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The\nsearch, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to\nthe world\u2019s pleasure and the increase of laughter.\n\nPAROLLES.\nA good knave, i\u2019 faith, and well fed.\nMadam, my lord will go away tonight;\nA very serious business calls on him.\nThe great prerogative and right of love,\nWhich, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;\nBut puts it off to a compell\u2019d restraint;\nWhose want, and whose delay, is strew\u2019d with sweets;\nWhich they distil now in the curbed time,\nTo make the coming hour o\u2019erflow with joy\nAnd pleasure drown the brim.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat\u2019s his will else?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat you will take your instant leave o\u2019 the king,\nAnd make this haste as your own good proceeding,\nStrengthen\u2019d with what apology you think\nMay make it probable need.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat more commands he?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat, having this obtain\u2019d, you presently\nAttend his further pleasure.\n\nHELENA.\nIn everything I wait upon his will.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI shall report it so.\n\nHELENA.\nI pray you. Come, sirrah.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Another room in the same.\n\n Enter Lafew and Bertram.\n\nLAFEW.\nBut I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou have it from his own deliverance.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd by other warranted testimony.\n\nLAFEW.\nThen my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and\naccordingly valiant.\n\nLAFEW.\nI have, then, sinned against his experience and transgressed against\nhis valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find\nin my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you make us friends; I\nwill pursue the amity.\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\n[_To Bertram._] These things shall be done, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nPray you, sir, who\u2019s his tailor?\n\nPAROLLES.\nSir!\n\nLAFEW.\nO, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a very good\ntailor.\n\nBERTRAM.\n[_Aside to Parolles._] Is she gone to the king?\n\nPAROLLES.\nShe is.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWill she away tonight?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAs you\u2019ll have her.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,\nGiven order for our horses; and tonight,\nWhen I should take possession of the bride,\nEnd ere I do begin.\n\nLAFEW.\nA good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one\nthat lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand\nnothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.\u2014 God save you,\nCaptain.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIs there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know not how I have deserved to run into my lord\u2019s displeasure.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou have made shift to run into \u2019t, boots and spurs and all, like him\nthat leapt into the custard; and out of it you\u2019ll run again, rather\nthan suffer question for your residence.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt may be you have mistaken him, my lord.\n\nLAFEW.\nAnd shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers. Fare you well,\nmy lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernal in this light\nnut; the soul of this man is his clothes; trust him not in matter of\nheavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures.\nFarewell, monsieur; I have spoken better of you than you have or will\nto deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nAn idle lord, I swear.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI think so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, do you not know him?\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, I do know him well; and common speech\nGives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nHELENA.\nI have, sir, as I was commanded from you,\nSpoke with the king, and have procur\u2019d his leave\nFor present parting; only he desires\nSome private speech with you.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI shall obey his will.\nYou must not marvel, Helen, at my course,\nWhich holds not colour with the time, nor does\nThe ministration and required office\nOn my particular. Prepared I was not\nFor such a business; therefore am I found\nSo much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you;\nThat presently you take your way for home,\nAnd rather muse than ask why I entreat you:\nFor my respects are better than they seem;\nAnd my appointments have in them a need\nGreater than shows itself at the first view\nTo you that know them not. This to my mother.\n\n [_Giving a letter._]\n\n\u2019Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so\nI leave you to your wisdom.\n\nHELENA.\nSir, I can nothing say\nBut that I am your most obedient servant.\n\nBERTRAM.\nCome, come, no more of that.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd ever shall\nWith true observance seek to eke out that\nWherein toward me my homely stars have fail\u2019d\nTo equal my great fortune.\n\nBERTRAM.\nLet that go.\nMy haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.\n\nHELENA.\nPray, sir, your pardon.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWell, what would you say?\n\nHELENA.\nI am not worthy of the wealth I owe;\nNor dare I say \u2019tis mine, and yet it is;\nBut, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal\nWhat law does vouch mine own.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat would you have?\n\nHELENA.\nSomething; and scarce so much; nothing indeed.\nI would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes,\nStrangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.\n\nHELENA.\nI shall not break your bidding, good my lord.\nWhere are my other men, monsieur?\nFarewell,\n\n [_Exit Helena._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nGo thou toward home, where I will never come\nWhilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.\nAway, and for our flight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBravely, coragio!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE I.

Where is my son, I pray you?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nMadam, he\u2019s gone to serve the Duke of Florence;\nWe met him thitherward, for thence we came,\nAnd, after some despatch in hand at court,\nThither we bend again.\n\nHELENA.\nLook on this letter, madam; here\u2019s my passport.\n\n[_Reads._] _When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never\nshall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am\nfather to, then call me husband; but in such a \u201cthen\u201d I write a\n\u201cnever\u201d._\nThis is a dreadful sentence.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBrought you this letter, gentlemen?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nAy, madam; And for the contents\u2019 sake, are sorry for our pains.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI pr\u2019ythee, lady, have a better cheer;\nIf thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,\nThou robb\u2019st me of a moiety.

Poor lord, is\u2019t I\nThat chase thee from thy country, and expose\nThose tender limbs of thine to the event\nOf the none-sparing war? And is it I\nThat drive thee from the sportive court, where thou\nWast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark\nOf smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to\u2019t;\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause\nHis death was so effected. Better \u2019twere\nI met the ravin lion when he roar\u2019d\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better \u2019twere\nThat all the miseries which nature owes\nWere mine at once. No; come thou home, Rossillon,\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,\nAs oft it loses all. I will be gone;\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.\nShall I stay here to do\u2019t? No, no, although\nThe air of paradise did fan the house,\nAnd angels offic\u2019d all. I will be gone,\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight\nTo consolate thine ear.

Hark! you may\nknow by their trumpets.\n\nMARIANA.\nCome, let\u2019s return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it.\nWell, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the honour of a maid is her\nname; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.\n\nWIDOW.\nI have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his\ncompanion.\n\nMARIANA.\nI know that knave; hang him! one Parolles; a filthy officer he is in\nthose suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their\npromises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust,\nare not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by\nthem; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck\nof maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they\nare limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to\nadvise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you\nare, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is\nso lost.\n\nDIANA.\nYou shall not need to fear me.\n\n Enter Helena in the dress of a pilgrim.\n\nWIDOW.\nI hope so.

Whither are bound?\n\nHELENA.\nTo Saint Jaques le Grand.\nWhere do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\n\nWIDOW.\nAt the Saint Francis here, beside the port.\n\nHELENA.\nIs this the way?\n\n [_A march afar._]\n\nWIDOW.\nAy, marry, is\u2019t.

Know you such a one?\n\nHELENA.\nBut by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;\nHis face I know not.\n\nDIANA.\nWhatsome\u2019er he is,\nHe\u2019s bravely taken here. He stole from France,\nAs \u2019tis reported, for the king had married him\nAgainst his liking. Think you it is so?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.\n\nDIANA.\nThere is a gentleman that serves the count\nReports but coarsely of her.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat\u2019s his name?\n\nDIANA.\nMonsieur Parolles.\n\nHELENA.\nO, I believe with him,\nIn argument of praise, or to the worth\nOf the great count himself, she is too mean\nTo have her name repeated; all her deserving\nIs a reserved honesty, and that\nI have not heard examin\u2019d.\n\nDIANA.\nAlas, poor lady!\n\u2019Tis a hard bondage to become the wife\nOf a detesting lord.\n\nWIDOW.\nAy, right; good creature, wheresoe\u2019er she is,\nHer heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her\nA shrewd turn, if she pleas\u2019d.\n\nHELENA.\nHow do you mean?\nMaybe the amorous count solicits her\nIn the unlawful purpose.\n\nWIDOW.\nHe does indeed,\nAnd brokes with all that can in such a suit\nCorrupt the tender honour of a maid;\nBut she is arm\u2019d for him, and keeps her guard\nIn honestest defence.\n\n Enter, with a drum and colours, a party of the Florentine army,\n Bertram and Parolles.\n\nMARIANA.\nThe gods forbid else!\n\nWIDOW.\nSo, now they come.\nThat is Antonio, the Duke\u2019s eldest son;\nThat Escalus.\n\nHELENA.\nWhich is the Frenchman?\n\nDIANA.\nHe;\nThat with the plume; \u2019tis a most gallant fellow.\nI would he lov\u2019d his wife; if he were honester\nHe were much goodlier. Is\u2019t not a handsome gentleman?\n\nHELENA.\nI like him well.\n\nDIANA.\n\u2019Tis pity he is not honest. Yond\u2019s that same knave\nThat leads him to these places. Were I his lady\nI would poison that vile rascal.\n\nHELENA.\nWhich is he?\n\nDIANA.\nThat jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?\n\nHELENA.\nPerchance he\u2019s hurt i\u2019 the battle.\n\nPAROLLES.\nLose our drum! Well.\n\nMARIANA.\nHe\u2019s shrewdly vex\u2019d at something. Look, he has spied us.\n\nWIDOW.\nMarry, hang you!\n\nMARIANA.\nAnd your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, Officers and Soldiers._]\n\nWIDOW.\nThe troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you\nWhere you shall host; of enjoin\u2019d penitents\nThere\u2019s four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,\nAlready at my house.\n\nHELENA.\nI humbly thank you.\nPlease it this matron and this gentle maid\nTo eat with us tonight; the charge and thanking\nShall be for me; and, to requite you further,\nI will bestow some precepts of this virgin,\nWorthy the note.\n\nBOTH.\nWe\u2019ll take your offer kindly.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Camp before Florence.\n\n Enter Bertram and the two French Lords.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, good my lord, put him to\u2019t; let him have his way.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIf your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your\nrespect.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nOn my life, my lord, a bubble.\n\nBERTRAM.\nDo you think I am so far deceived in him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBelieve it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice,\nbut to speak of him as my kinsman, he\u2019s a most notable coward, an\ninfinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no\none good quality worthy your lordship\u2019s entertainment.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which\nhe hath not, he might at some great and trusty business, in a main\ndanger fail you.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI would I knew in what particular action to try him.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNone better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so\nconfidently undertake to do.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him; such I will\nhave whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy; we will bind and\nhoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried\ninto the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents.\nBe but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not for the\npromise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer\nto betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against\nyou, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never\ntrust my judgment in anything.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a\nstratagem for\u2019t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success\nin\u2019t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if\nyou give him not John Drum\u2019s entertainment, your inclining cannot be\nremoved. Here he comes.\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let\nhim fetch off his drum in any hand.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHow now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nA pox on \u2019t; let it go; \u2019tis but a drum.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBut a drum! Is\u2019t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent\ncommand, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend\nour own soldiers.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThat was not to be blam\u2019d in the command of the service; it was a\ndisaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had\nbeen there to command.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in\nthe loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt might have been recovered.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt might, but it is not now.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom\nattributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or\nanother, or _hic jacet_.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to\u2019t, monsieur, if you think your mystery\nin stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native\nquarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the\nattempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall\nboth speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,\neven to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI\u2019ll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,\nencourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal\npreparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI know th\u2019art valiant; and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will\nsubscribe for thee. Farewell.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI love not many words.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,\nthat so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is\nnot to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn\u2019d than to\ndo\u2019t.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou do not know him, my lord, as we do; certain it is that he will\nsteal himself into a man\u2019s favour, and for a week escape a great deal\nof discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all of this, that so\nseriously he does address himself unto?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNone in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two\nor three probable lies; but we have almost embossed him; you shall see\nhis fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship\u2019s respect.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe\u2019ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first\nsmok\u2019d by the old Lord Lafew; when his disguise and he is parted, tell\nme what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very\nnight.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI must go look my twigs. He shall be caught.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYour brother, he shall go along with me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAs\u2019t please your lordship. I\u2019ll leave you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNow will I lead you to the house, and show you\nThe lass I spoke of.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBut you say she\u2019s honest.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThat\u2019s all the fault. I spoke with her but once,\nAnd found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her\nBy this same coxcomb that we have i\u2019 the wind\nTokens and letters which she did re-send,\nAnd this is all I have done. She\u2019s a fair creature;\nWill you go see her?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWith all my heart, my lord.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. Florence.

The count he woos your daughter\nLays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\nResolv\u2019d to carry her; let her in fine consent,\nAs we\u2019ll direct her how \u2019tis best to bear it.\nNow his important blood will naught deny\nThat she\u2019ll demand; a ring the county wears,\nThat downward hath succeeded in his house\nFrom son to son, some four or five descents\nSince the first father wore it. This ring he holds\nIn most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,\nTo buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\nHowe\u2019er repented after.\n\nWIDOW.\nNow I see\nThe bottom of your purpose.\n\nHELENA.\nYou see it lawful then; it is no more\nBut that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\nDesires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\nIn fine, delivers me to fill the time,\nHerself most chastely absent. After,\nTo marry her, I\u2019ll add three thousand crowns\nTo what is pass\u2019d already.\n\nWIDOW.\nI have yielded.\nInstruct my daughter how she shall persever,\nThat time and place with this deceit so lawful\nMay prove coherent. Every night he comes\nWith musics of all sorts, and songs compos\u2019d\nTo her unworthiness: it nothing steads us\nTo chide him from our eaves; for he persists\nAs if his life lay on \u2019t.\n\nHELENA.\nWhy then tonight\nLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,\nIs wicked meaning in a lawful deed,\nAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,\nWhere both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.\nBut let\u2019s about it.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.\n\n Enter first Lord with five or six Soldiers in ambush.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon\nhim, speak what terrible language you will; though you understand it\nnot yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him,\nunless someone among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nGood captain, let me be th\u2019 interpreter.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nArt not acquainted with him?

Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages,\ntherefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what\nwe speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our\npurpose: choughs\u2019 language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\ninterpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes;\nto beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies\nhe forges.\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\nTen o\u2019clock. Within these three hours \u2019twill be time enough to go home.\nWhat shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that\ncarries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock\u2019d\ntoo often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart\nhath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the\nreports of my tongue.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] This is the first truth that e\u2019er thine own tongue was\nguilty of.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum,\nbeing not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such\npurpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit;\nyet slight ones will not carry it. They will say \u201cCame you off with so\nlittle?\u201d and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what\u2019s the\ninstance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman\u2019s mouth, and buy\nmyself another of Bajazet\u2019s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the\nbreaking of my Spanish sword.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] We cannot afford you so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] \u2019Twould not do.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Hardly serve.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThough I swore I leap\u2019d from the window of the citadel,\u2014\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] How deep?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThirty fathom.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would I had any drum of the enemy\u2019s; I would swear I recover\u2019d it.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] You shall hear one anon.\n\nPAROLLES.\nA drum now of the enemy\u2019s!\n\n [_Alarum within._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\n_Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo._\n\nALL.\n_Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo._\n\n [_They seize and blindfold him._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nO, ransom, ransom!

But, fair soul,\nIn your fine frame hath love no quality?\nIf the quick fire of youth light not your mind,\nYou are no maiden but a monument;\nWhen you are dead, you should be such a one\nAs you are now; for you are cold and stern,\nAnd now you should be as your mother was\nWhen your sweet self was got.\n\nDIANA.\nShe then was honest.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSo should you be.\n\nDIANA.\nNo.\nMy mother did but duty; such, my lord,\nAs you owe to your wife.\n\nBERTRAM.\nNo more a\u2019 that!\nI pr\u2019ythee do not strive against my vows;\nI was compell\u2019d to her; but I love thee\nBy love\u2019s own sweet constraint, and will for ever\nDo thee all rights of service.\n\nDIANA.\nAy, so you serve us\nTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,\nYou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,\nAnd mock us with our bareness.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHow have I sworn?\n\nDIANA.\n\u2019Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\nBut the plain single vow that is vow\u2019d true.\nWhat is not holy, that we swear not by,\nBut take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\nIf I should swear by Jove\u2019s great attributes\nI lov\u2019d you dearly, would you believe my oaths\nWhen I did love you ill? This has no holding,\nTo swear by him whom I protest to love\nThat I will work against him. Therefore your oaths\nAre words and poor conditions; but unseal\u2019d,\u2014\nAt least in my opinion.\n\nBERTRAM.\nChange it, change it.\nBe not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;\nAnd my integrity ne\u2019er knew the crafts\nThat you do charge men with. Stand no more off,\nBut give thyself unto my sick desires,\nWho then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever\nMy love as it begins shall so persever.\n\nDIANA.\nI see that men make hopes in such a case,\nThat we\u2019ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI\u2019ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power\nTo give it from me.\n\nDIANA.\nWill you not, my lord?\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt is an honour \u2019longing to our house,\nBequeathed down from many ancestors,\nWhich were the greatest obloquy i\u2019 the world\nIn me to lose.\n\nDIANA.\nMine honour\u2019s such a ring;\nMy chastity\u2019s the jewel of our house,\nBequeathed down from many ancestors,\nWhich were the greatest obloquy i\u2019 the world\nIn me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom\nBrings in the champion honour on my part\nAgainst your vain assault.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHere, take my ring;\nMy house, mine honour, yea, my life be thine,\nAnd I\u2019ll be bid by thee.\n\nDIANA.\nWhen midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;\nI\u2019ll order take my mother shall not hear.\nNow will I charge you in the band of truth,\nWhen you have conquer\u2019d my yet maiden-bed,\nRemain there but an hour, nor speak to me.\nMy reasons are most strong; and you shall know them\nWhen back again this ring shall be deliver\u2019d;\nAnd on your finger in the night, I\u2019ll put\nAnother ring, that what in time proceeds\nMay token to the future our past deeds.\nAdieu till then; then fail not. You have won\nA wife of me, though there my hope be done.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nDIANA.\nFor which live long to thank both heaven and me!\nYou may so in the end.\nMy mother told me just how he would woo,\nAs if she sat in\u2019s heart. She says all men\nHave the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me\nWhen his wife\u2019s dead; therefore I\u2019ll lie with him\nWhen I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,\nMarry that will, I live and die a maid.\nOnly, in this disguise, I think\u2019t no sin\nTo cozen him that would unjustly win.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. The Florentine camp.\n\n Enter the two French Lords and two or three Soldiers.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou have not given him his mother\u2019s letter?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI have deliv\u2019red it an hour since; there is something in\u2019t that stings\nhis nature; for on the reading it, he chang\u2019d almost into another man.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife\nand so sweet a lady.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nEspecially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king,\nwho had even tun\u2019d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you\na thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWhen you have spoken it, \u2019tis dead, and I am the grave of it.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most\nchaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her\nhonour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made\nin the unchaste composition.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNow, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons,\nwe still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr\u2019d\nends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in\nhis proper stream, o\u2019erflows himself.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful\nintents? We shall not then have his company tonight?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThat approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company\nanatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein\nso curiously he had set this counterfeit.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the\nwhip of the other.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIn the meantime, what hear you of these wars?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWhat will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return\nagain into France?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nLet it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence\nis a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with\nmost austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a\ngroan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHow is this justified?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true,\neven to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be\nher office to say is come, was faithfully confirm\u2019d by the rector of\nthe place.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHath the count all this intelligence?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAy, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full\narming of the verity.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI am heartily sorry that he\u2019ll be glad of this.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great\ndignity that his valour hath here acquir\u2019d for him shall at home be\nencountered with a shame as ample.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our\nvirtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes\nwould despair if they were not cherish\u2019d by our virtues.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nHow now? Where\u2019s your master?\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn\nleave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered\nhim letters of commendations to the king.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they\ncan commend.\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king\u2019s tartness. Here\u2019s his lordship\nnow. How now, my lord, is\u2019t not after midnight?\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have tonight despatch\u2019d sixteen businesses, a month\u2019s length apiece;\nby an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu\nwith his nearest; buried a wife, mourn\u2019d for her, writ to my lady\nmother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main\nparcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the\ngreatest, but that I have not ended yet.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIf the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure\nhence, it requires haste of your lordship.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter.\nBut shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,\nbring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv\u2019d me like a\ndouble-meaning prophesier.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBring him forth.\n\n [_Exeunt Soldiers._]\n\nHas sat i\u2019 the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.\n\nBERTRAM.\nNo matter; his heels have deserv\u2019d it, in usurping his spurs so long.\nHow does he carry himself?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer\nyou as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her\nmilk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a\nfriar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster\nof his setting i\u2019 the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?\n\nBERTRAM.\nNothing of me, has he?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your\nlordship be in\u2019t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to\nhear it.\n\n Enter Soldiers with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHe calls for the tortures. What will you say without \u2019em?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a\npasty I can say no more.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n_Bosko chimurcho._\n\nFIRST LORD.\n_Boblibindo chicurmurco._\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall\nask you out of a note.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAnd truly, as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n\u2018First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.\u2019 What say you\nto that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are\nall scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation\nand credit, and as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nShall I set down your answer so?\n\nPAROLLES.\nDo. I\u2019ll take the sacrament on \u2019t, how and which way you will.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAll\u2019s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant\nmilitarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war\nin the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe\nhe can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that\u2019s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\n\u2018Five or six thousand horse\u2019 I said\u2014I will say true\u2014or thereabouts, set\ndown,\u2014for I\u2019ll speak truth.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe\u2019s very near the truth in this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut I con him no thanks for\u2019t in the nature he delivers it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nPoor rogues, I pray you say.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that\u2019s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI humbly thank you, sir; a truth\u2019s a truth, the rogues are marvellous\npoor.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n\u2018Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.\u2019 What say you to that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell\ntrue. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many;\nCorambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and\nGratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond,\nBentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and\nsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the\nwhich dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake\nthemselves to pieces.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat shall be done to him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what\ncredit I have with the duke.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that\u2019s set down. \u2018You shall demand of him whether one Captain\nDumaine be i\u2019 the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the\nduke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he\nthinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt\nhim to a revolt.\u2019 What say you to this? What do you know of it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter\u2019gatories.\nDemand them singly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nDo you know this Captain Dumaine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know him: he was a botcher\u2019s \u2019prentice in Paris, from whence he was\nwhipped for getting the shrieve\u2019s fool with child, a dumb innocent that\ncould not say him nay.\n\n [_First Lord lifts up his hand in anger._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are\nforfeit to the next tile that falls.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, is this captain in the Duke of Florence\u2019s camp?\n\nPAROLLES.\nUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat is his reputation with the duke?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to\nme this other day to turn him out o\u2019 the band. I think I have his\nletter in my pocket.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nMarry, we\u2019ll search.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a\nfile, with the duke\u2019s other letters, in my tent.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHere \u2019tis; here\u2019s a paper; shall I read it to you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI do not know if it be it or no.\n\nBERTRAM.\nOur interpreter does it well.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nExcellently.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[_Reads._] _Dian, the Count\u2019s a fool, and full of gold._\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat is not the duke\u2019s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a\nproper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of\none Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish.\nI pray you, sir, put it up again.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nNay, I\u2019ll read it first by your favour.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy meaning in\u2019t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid;\nfor I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is\na whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.\n\nBERTRAM.\nDamnable both sides rogue!\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[_Reads._]\n_When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\nAfter he scores, he never pays the score.\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\nHe ne\u2019er pays after-debts, take it before.\nAnd say a soldier, \u2018Dian,\u2019 told thee this:\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;\nFor count of this, the count\u2019s a fool, I know it,\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\nThine, as he vow\u2019d to thee in thine ear,_\n                                     PAROLLES.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in\u2019s forehead.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the\narmipotent soldier.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI could endure anything before but a cat, and now he\u2019s a cat to me.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI perceive, sir, by our general\u2019s looks we shall be fain to hang you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my\noffences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me\nlive, sir, in a dungeon, i\u2019 the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWe\u2019ll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more\nto this Captain Dumaine: you have answer\u2019d to his reputation with the\nduke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments\nhe parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking\nthem he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such\nvolubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his\nbest virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does\nlittle harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his\nconditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of\nhis honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what\nan honest man should have, he has nothing.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI begin to love him for this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nFor this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he\u2019s more\nand more a cat.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat say you to his expertness in war?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,\u2014to belie\nhim I will not,\u2014and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that\ncountry he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called\nMile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man\nwhat honour I can, but of this I am not certain.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe hath out-villain\u2019d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA pox on him! He\u2019s a cat still.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHis qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold\nwill corrupt him to revolt.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSir, for a quart d\u2019ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation,\nthe inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a\nperpetual succession for it perpetually.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat\u2019s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWhy does he ask him of me?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat\u2019s he?\n\nPAROLLES.\nE\u2019en a crow o\u2019 the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in\ngoodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a\ncoward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a\nretreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI\u2019ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.\n\nPAROLLES.\n[_Aside._] I\u2019ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem\nto deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious\nyoung boy the count, have I run into this danger: yet who would have\nsuspected an ambush where I was taken?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThere is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says you that\nhave so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such\npestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no\nhonest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.\n\nPAROLLES.\nO Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThat shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.\n\n [_Unmuffling him._]\n\nSo, look about you; know you any here?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGood morrow, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nGod bless you, Captain Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGod save you, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nCaptain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am for France.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGood Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana\nin behalf of the Count Rossillon? And I were not a very coward I\u2019d\ncompel it of you; but fare you well.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram, Lords &c._]\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are undone, captain: all but your scarf; that has a knot on\u2019t yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWho cannot be crushed with a plot?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf you could find out a country where but women were that had received\nso much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I\nam for France too; we shall speak of you there.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nYet am I thankful. If my heart were great\n\u2019Twould burst at this. Captain I\u2019ll be no more,\nBut I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft\nAs captain shall. Simply the thing I am\nShall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,\nLet him fear this; for it will come to pass\nThat every braggart shall be found an ass.\nRust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live\nSafest in shame; being fool\u2019d, by foolery thrive.\nThere\u2019s place and means for every man alive.\nI\u2019ll after them.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV. Florence. A room in the Widow\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Helena, Widow and Diana.\n\nHELENA.\nThat you may well perceive I have not wrong\u2019d you\nOne of the greatest in the Christian world\nShall be my surety; fore whose throne \u2019tis needful,\nEre I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.\nTime was I did him a desired office,\nDear almost as his life; which gratitude\nThrough flinty Tartar\u2019s bosom would peep forth,\nAnd answer thanks. I duly am inform\u2019d\nHis grace is at Marseilles; to which place\nWe have convenient convoy. You must know\nI am supposed dead. The army breaking,\nMy husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding,\nAnd by the leave of my good lord the king,\nWe\u2019ll be before our welcome.\n\nWIDOW.\nGentle madam,\nYou never had a servant to whose trust\nYour business was more welcome.\n\nHELENA.\nNor you, mistress,\nEver a friend whose thoughts more truly labour\nTo recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven\nHath brought me up to be your daughter\u2019s dower,\nAs it hath fated her to be my motive\nAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen\u2019d thoughts\nDefiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play\nWith what it loathes, for that which is away.\nBut more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\nUnder my poor instructions yet must suffer\nSomething in my behalf.\n\nDIANA.\nLet death and honesty\nGo with your impositions, I am yours\nUpon your will to suffer.\n\nHELENA.\nYet, I pray you;\nBut with the word the time will bring on summer,\nWhen briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,\nAnd be as sweet as sharp. We must away;\nOur waggon is prepar\u2019d, and time revives us.\nAll\u2019s well that ends well; still the fine\u2019s the crown.\nWhate\u2019er the course, the end is the renown.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Rossillon. A room in the Countess\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there,\nwhose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak\u2019d and doughy\nyouth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at\nthis hour, and your son here at home, more advanc\u2019d by the king than by\nthat red-tail\u2019d humble-bee I speak of.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous\ngentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had\npartaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\n\nLAFEW.\n\u2019Twas a good lady, \u2019twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere\nwe light on such another herb.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the\nherb of grace.\n\nLAFEW.\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,\u2014a knave or a fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nA fool, sir, at a woman\u2019s service, and a knave at a man\u2019s.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour distinction?\n\nCLOWN.\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\n\nLAFEW.\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\n\nCLOWN.\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n\nLAFEW.\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nAt your service.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you\nare.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho\u2019s that? a Frenchman?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, sir, \u2019a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in\nFrance than there.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhat prince is that?\n\nCLOWN.\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\n\nLAFEW.\nHold thee, there\u2019s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from\nthy master thou talk\u2019st of; serve him still.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the\nmaster I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of\nthe world; let his nobility remain in\u2019s court. I am for the house with\nthe narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some\nthat humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender,\nand they\u2019ll be for the flow\u2019ry way that leads to the broad gate and the\ngreat fire.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before,\nbecause I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be\nwell look\u2019d to, without any tricks.\n\nCLOWN.\nIf I put any tricks upon \u2019em, sir, they shall be jades\u2019 tricks, which\nare their own right by the law of nature.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nLAFEW.\nA shrewd knave, and an unhappy.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSo he is. My lord that\u2019s gone made himself much sport out of him; by\nhis authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his\nsauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.\n\nLAFEW.\nI like him well; \u2019tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I\nheard of the good lady\u2019s death, and that my lord your son was upon his\nreturn home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my\ndaughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a\nself-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis\u2019d\nme to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against\nyour son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWith very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.\n\nLAFEW.\nHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he\nnumber\u2019d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that\nin such intelligence hath seldom fail\u2019d.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters\nthat my son will be here tonight. I shall beseech your lordship to\nremain with me till they meet together.\n\nLAFEW.\nMadam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou need but plead your honourable privilege.\n\nLAFEW.\nLady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my God, it holds\nyet.\n\n Enter Clown.\n\nCLOWN.\nO madam, yonder\u2019s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on\u2019s face;\nwhether there be a scar under\u2019t or no, the velvet knows; but \u2019tis a\ngoodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a\nhalf, but his right cheek is worn bare.\n\nLAFEW.\nA scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so\nbelike is that.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut it is your carbonado\u2019d face.\n\nLAFEW.\nLet us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the young noble\nsoldier.\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, there\u2019s a dozen of \u2019em, with delicate fine hats, and most\ncourteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT V.\n\nSCENE I.

In happy time;\u2014\n\n Enter a Gentleman.\n\nThis man may help me to his majesty\u2019s ear,\nIf he would spend his power. God save you, sir.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nAnd you.\n\nHELENA.\nSir, I have seen you in the court of France.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI have been sometimes there.\n\nHELENA.\nI do presume, sir, that you are not fallen\nFrom the report that goes upon your goodness;\nAnd therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,\nWhich lay nice manners by, I put you to\nThe use of your own virtues, for the which\nI shall continue thankful.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nWhat\u2019s your will?\n\nHELENA.\nThat it will please you\nTo give this poor petition to the king,\nAnd aid me with that store of power you have\nTo come into his presence.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThe king\u2019s not here.\n\nHELENA.\nNot here, sir?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nNot indeed.\nHe hence remov\u2019d last night, and with more haste\nThan is his use.\n\nWIDOW.\nLord, how we lose our pains!\n\nHELENA.\nAll\u2019s well that ends well yet,\nThough time seem so adverse and means unfit.\nI do beseech you, whither is he gone?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nMarry, as I take it, to Rossillon;\nWhither I am going.\n\nHELENA.\nI do beseech you, sir,\nSince you are like to see the king before me,\nCommend the paper to his gracious hand,\nWhich I presume shall render you no blame,\nBut rather make you thank your pains for it.\nI will come after you with what good speed\nOur means will make us means.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThis I\u2019ll do for you.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you shall find yourself to be well thank\u2019d,\nWhate\u2019er falls more.

I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune\u2019s\nbuttering. Pr\u2019ythee, allow the wind.\n\nPAROLLES.\nNay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I spake but by a metaphor.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against\nany man\u2019s metaphor. Pr\u2019ythee, get thee further.\n\nPAROLLES.\nPray you, sir, deliver me this paper.\n\nCLOWN.\nFoh, pr\u2019ythee stand away. A paper from Fortune\u2019s close-stool to give to\na nobleman! Look here he comes himself.\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nHere is a pur of Fortune\u2019s, sir, or of Fortune\u2019s cat, but not a\nmusk-cat, that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure,\nand as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you\nmay, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally\nknave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him\nto your lordship.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch\u2019d.\n\nLAFEW.\nAnd what would you have me to do? \u2019Tis too late to pare her nails now.\nWherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch\nyou, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive\nlong under her? There\u2019s a quart d\u2019ecu for you. Let the justices make\nyou and Fortune friends; I am for other business.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI beseech your honour to hear me one single word.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou beg a single penny more. Come, you shall ha\u2019t; save your word.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy name, my good lord, is Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou beg more than word then. Cox my passion! Give me your hand. How\ndoes your drum?\n\nPAROLLES.\nO my good lord, you were the first that found me.\n\nLAFEW.\nWas I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring\nme out.\n\nLAFEW.\nOut upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of\nGod and the devil? One brings thee in grace, and the other brings thee\nout.\n\n [_Trumpets sound._]\n\nThe king\u2019s coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further\nafter me. I had talk of you last night; though you are a fool and a\nknave, you shall eat. Go to; follow.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI praise God for you.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. The same. A room in the Countess\u2019s palace.\n\n Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards &c.\n\nKING.\nWe lost a jewel of her, and our esteem\nWas made much poorer by it; but your son,\nAs mad in folly, lack\u2019d the sense to know\nHer estimation home.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\u2019Tis past, my liege,\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\nNatural rebellion, done i\u2019 the blaze of youth,\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason\u2019s force,\nO\u2019erbears it and burns on.\n\nKING.\nMy honour\u2019d lady,\nI have forgiven and forgotten all,\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\nAnd watch\u2019d the time to shoot.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis I must say,\u2014\nBut first, I beg my pardon,\u2014the young lord\nDid to his majesty, his mother, and his lady,\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\nOf richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn\u2019d to serve\nHumbly call\u2019d mistress.\n\nKING.\nPraising what is lost\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\nWe are reconcil\u2019d, and the first view shall kill\nAll repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\nAnd deeper than oblivion do we bury\nTh\u2019 incensing relics of it. Let him approach\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\nSo \u2019tis our will he should.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI shall, my liege.\n\n [_Exit Gentleman._]\n\nKING.\nWhat says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?\n\nLAFEW.\nAll that he is hath reference to your highness.\n\nKING.\nThen shall we have a match. I have letters sent me\nThat sets him high in fame.\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe looks well on \u2019t.\n\nKING.\nI am not a day of season,\nFor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\nIn me at once. But to the brightest beams\nDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\nThe time is fair again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy high-repented blames\nDear sovereign, pardon to me.\n\nKING.\nAll is whole.\nNot one word more of the consumed time.\nLet\u2019s take the instant by the forward top;\nFor we are old, and on our quick\u2019st decrees\nTh\u2019inaudible and noiseless foot of time\nSteals ere we can effect them. You remember\nThe daughter of this lord?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAdmiringly, my liege. At first\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\nDurst make too bold herald of my tongue:\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\nWhich warp\u2019d the line of every other favour,\nScorn\u2019d a fair colour, or express\u2019d it stolen,\nExtended or contracted all proportions\nTo a most hideous object. Thence it came\nThat she whom all men prais\u2019d, and whom myself,\nSince I have lost, have lov\u2019d, was in mine eye\nThe dust that did offend it.\n\nKING.\nWell excus\u2019d:\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\nCrying, That\u2019s good that\u2019s gone. Our rash faults\nMake trivial price of serious things we have,\nNot knowing them until we know their grave.\nOft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\nDestroy our friends, and after weep their dust:\nOur own love waking cries to see what\u2019s done,\nWhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.\nBe this sweet Helen\u2019s knell, and now forget her.\nSend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.\nThe main consents are had, and here we\u2019ll stay\nTo see our widower\u2019s second marriage-day.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!\nOr, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!\n\nLAFEW.\nCome on, my son, in whom my house\u2019s name\nMust be digested; give a favour from you,\nTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\nThat she may quickly come.\n\n [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]\n\nBy my old beard,\nAnd ev\u2019ry hair that\u2019s on \u2019t, Helen that\u2019s dead\nWas a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\nThe last that e\u2019er I took her leave at court,\nI saw upon her finger.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHers it was not.\n\nKING.\nNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\nWhile I was speaking, oft was fasten\u2019d to it.\nThis ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen\nI bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\nNecessitied to help, that by this token\nI would relieve her. Had you that craft to \u2019reave her\nOf what should stead her most?\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy gracious sovereign,\nHowe\u2019er it pleases you to take it so,\nThe ring was never hers.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSon, on my life,\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon\u2019d it\nAt her life\u2019s rate.\n\nLAFEW.\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYou are deceiv\u2019d, my lord; she never saw it.\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\nWrapp\u2019d in a paper, which contain\u2019d the name\nOf her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought\nI stood engag\u2019d; but when I had subscrib\u2019d\nTo mine own fortune, and inform\u2019d her fully\nI could not answer in that course of honour\nAs she had made the overture, she ceas\u2019d,\nIn heavy satisfaction, and would never\nReceive the ring again.\n\nKING.\nPlutus himself,\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\nHath not in nature\u2019s mystery more science\nThan I have in this ring. \u2019Twas mine, \u2019twas Helen\u2019s,\nWhoever gave it you. Then if you know\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\nConfess \u2019twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\nYou got it from her. She call\u2019d the saints to surety\nThat she would never put it from her finger\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\nUpon her great disaster.\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe never saw it.\n\nKING.\nThou speak\u2019st it falsely, as I love mine honour,\nAnd mak\u2019st conjectural fears to come into me\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\nThat thou art so inhuman,\u2014\u2019twill not prove so:\nAnd yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly.\nAnd she is dead; which nothing but to close\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\n\n [_Guards seize Bertram._]\n\nMy fore-past proofs, howe\u2019er the matter fall,\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\nHaving vainly fear\u2019d too little. Away with him.\nWe\u2019ll sift this matter further.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIf you shall prove\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\nWhere she yet never was.\n\n [_Exit, guarded._]\n\nKING.\nI am wrapp\u2019d in dismal thinkings.\n\n Enter a Gentleman.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nGracious sovereign,\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\nHere\u2019s a petition from a Florentine,\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\nTo tender it herself. I undertook it,\nVanquish\u2019d thereto by the fair grace and speech\nOf the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,\nIs here attending: her business looks in her\nWith an importing visage, and she told me\nIn a sweet verbal brief, it did concern\nYour highness with herself.\n\nKING.\n[_Reads._] _Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was\ndead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillon a\nwidower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour\u2019s paid to him. He\nstole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country\nfor justice. Grant it me, O king, in you it best lies; otherwise a\nseducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone._\n                                    DIANA CAPILET.\n\nLAFEW.\nI will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I\u2019ll none of\nhim.\n\nKING.\nThe heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,\nTo bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors.\nGo speedily, and bring again the count.\n\n [_Exeunt Gentleman and some Attendants._]\n\nI am afeard the life of Helen, lady,\nWas foully snatch\u2019d.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNow, justice on the doers!\n\n Enter Bertram, guarded.\n\nKING.\nI wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you,\nAnd that you fly them as you swear them lordship,\nYet you desire to marry. What woman\u2019s that?\n\n Enter Widow and Diana.\n\nDIANA.\nI am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,\nDerived from the ancient Capilet;\nMy suit, as I do understand, you know,\nAnd therefore know how far I may be pitied.\n\nWIDOW.\nI am her mother, sir, whose age and honour\nBoth suffer under this complaint we bring,\nAnd both shall cease, without your remedy.\n\nKING.\nCome hither, count; do you know these women?\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I neither can nor will deny\nBut that I know them. Do they charge me further?\n\nDIANA.\nWhy do you look so strange upon your wife?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe\u2019s none of mine, my lord.\n\nDIANA.\nIf you shall marry,\nYou give away this hand, and that is mine,\nYou give away heaven\u2019s vows, and those are mine,\nYou give away myself, which is known mine;\nFor I by vow am so embodied yours\nThat she which marries you must marry me,\nEither both or none.\n\nLAFEW.\n[_To Bertram_] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are\nno husband for her.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, this is a fond and desperate creature\nWhom sometime I have laugh\u2019d with. Let your highness\nLay a more noble thought upon mine honour\nThan for to think that I would sink it here.\n\nKING.\nSir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend\nTill your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour\nThan in my thought it lies!\n\nDIANA.\nGood my lord,\nAsk him upon his oath, if he does think\nHe had not my virginity.\n\nKING.\nWhat say\u2019st thou to her?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe\u2019s impudent, my lord,\nAnd was a common gamester to the camp.\n\nDIANA.\nHe does me wrong, my lord; if I were so\nHe might have bought me at a common price.\nDo not believe him. O, behold this ring,\nWhose high respect and rich validity\nDid lack a parallel; yet for all that\nHe gave it to a commoner o\u2019 the camp,\nIf I be one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe blushes, and \u2019tis it.\nOf six preceding ancestors, that gem\nConferr\u2019d by testament to th\u2019 sequent issue,\nHath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;\nThat ring\u2019s a thousand proofs.\n\nKING.\nMethought you said\nYou saw one here in court could witness it.\n\nDIANA.\nI did, my lord, but loath am to produce\nSo bad an instrument; his name\u2019s Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nI saw the man today, if man he be.\n\nKING.\nFind him, and bring him hither.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat of him?\nHe\u2019s quoted for a most perfidious slave,\nWith all the spots o\u2019 the world tax\u2019d and debauch\u2019d:\nWhose nature sickens but to speak a truth.\nAm I or that or this for what he\u2019ll utter,\nThat will speak anything?\n\nKING.\nShe hath that ring of yours.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI think she has. Certain it is I lik\u2019d her\nAnd boarded her i\u2019 the wanton way of youth.\nShe knew her distance, and did angle for me,\nMadding my eagerness with her restraint,\nAs all impediments in fancy\u2019s course\nAre motives of more fancy; and in fine,\nHer infinite cunning with her modern grace,\nSubdu\u2019d me to her rate; she got the ring,\nAnd I had that which any inferior might\nAt market-price have bought.\n\nDIANA.\nI must be patient.\nYou that have turn\u2019d off a first so noble wife\nMay justly diet me. I pray you yet,\u2014\nSince you lack virtue, I will lose a husband\u2014\nSend for your ring, I will return it home,\nAnd give me mine again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have it not.\n\nKING.\nWhat ring was yours, I pray you?\n\nDIANA.\nSir, much like\nThe same upon your finger.\n\nKING.\nKnow you this ring? This ring was his of late.\n\nDIANA.\nAnd this was it I gave him, being abed.\n\nKING.\nThe story then goes false you threw it him\nOut of a casement.\n\nDIANA.\nI have spoke the truth.\n\n Enter Attendant with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I do confess the ring was hers.\n\nKING.\nYou boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.\nIs this the man you speak of?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my lord.\n\nKING.\nTell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,\nNot fearing the displeasure of your master,\nWhich on your just proceeding, I\u2019ll keep off,\u2014\nBy him and by this woman here what know you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nSo please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman.\nTricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.\n\nKING.\nCome, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, he did love her; but how?\n\nKING.\nHow, I pray you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.\n\nKING.\nHow is that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe lov\u2019d her, sir, and lov\u2019d her not.\n\nKING.\nAs thou art a knave and no knave.\nWhat an equivocal companion is this!\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am a poor man, and at your majesty\u2019s command.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe\u2019s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.\n\nDIANA.\nDo you know he promised me marriage?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, I know more than I\u2019ll speak.\n\nKING.\nBut wilt thou not speak all thou know\u2019st?\n\nPAROLLES.\nYes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more\nthan that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of\nSatan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in\nthat credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed;\nand of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would\nderive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.\n\nKING.\nThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married;\nbut thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This\nring, you say, was yours?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you buy it? Or who gave it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not given me, nor I did not buy it.\n\nKING.\nWho lent it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not lent me neither.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you find it then?\n\nDIANA.\nI found it not.\n\nKING.\nIf it were yours by none of all these ways,\nHow could you give it him?\n\nDIANA.\nI never gave it him.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis woman\u2019s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.\n\nKING.\nThis ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.\n\nDIANA.\nIt might be yours or hers for ought I know.\n\nKING.\nTake her away, I do not like her now.\nTo prison with her. And away with him.\nUnless thou tell\u2019st me where thou hadst this ring,\nThou diest within this hour.\n\nDIANA.\nI\u2019ll never tell you.\n\nKING.\nTake her away.\n\nDIANA.\nI\u2019ll put in bail, my liege.\n\nKING.\nI think thee now some common customer.\n\nDIANA.\nBy Jove, if ever I knew man, \u2019twas you.\n\nKING.\nWherefore hast thou accus\u2019d him all this while?\n\nDIANA.\nBecause he\u2019s guilty, and he is not guilty.\nHe knows I am no maid, and he\u2019ll swear to\u2019t:\nI\u2019ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.\nGreat King, I am no strumpet, by my life;\nI am either maid, or else this old man\u2019s wife.\n\n [_Pointing to Lafew._]\n\nKING.\nShe does abuse our ears; to prison with her.\n\nDIANA.\nGood mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;\n\n [_Exit Widow._]\n\nThe jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,\nAnd he shall surety me. But for this lord\nWho hath abus\u2019d me as he knows himself,\nThough yet he never harm\u2019d me, here I quit him.\nHe knows himself my bed he hath defil\u2019d;\nAnd at that time he got his wife with child.\nDead though she be, she feels her young one kick;\nSo there\u2019s my riddle: one that\u2019s dead is quick,\nAnd now behold the meaning.\n\n Enter Widow with Helena.\n\nKING.\nIs there no exorcist\nBeguiles the truer office of mine eyes?\nIs\u2019t real that I see?\n\nHELENA.\nNo, my good lord;\n\u2019Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,\nThe name, and not the thing.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBoth, both.

Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Demetrius and Philo.\n\nPHILO.\nNay, but this dotage of our general\u2019s\nO\u2019erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,\nThat o\u2019er the files and musters of the war\nHave glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn\nThe office and devotion of their view\nUpon a tawny front. His captain\u2019s heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of great fights hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper\nAnd is become the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gipsy\u2019s lust.\n\n Flourish. Enter Antony and Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with\n Eunuchs fanning her.\n\nLook where they come:\nTake but good note, and you shall see in him\nThe triple pillar of the world transform\u2019d\nInto a strumpet\u2019s fool. Behold and see.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIf it be love indeed, tell me how much.\n\nANTONY.\nThere\u2019s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI\u2019ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.\n\nANTONY.\nThen must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nNews, my good lord, from Rome.\n\nANTONY.\nGrates me, the sum.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, hear them, Antony.\nFulvia perchance is angry; or who knows\nIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent\nHis powerful mandate to you: \u201cDo this or this;\nTake in that kingdom and enfranchise that.\nPerform\u2019t, or else we damn thee.\u201d\n\nANTONY.\nHow, my love?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPerchance! Nay, and most like.\nYou must not stay here longer; your dismission\nIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.\nWhere\u2019s Fulvia\u2019s process?\u2014Caesar\u2019s I would say? Both?\nCall in the messengers. As I am Egypt\u2019s queen,\nThou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine\nIs Caesar\u2019s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame\nWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!\n\nANTONY.\nLet Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\nOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.\nKingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike\nFeeds beast as man. The nobleness of life\nIs to do thus [_Embracing_]; when such a mutual pair\nAnd such a twain can do\u2019t, in which I bind,\nOn pain of punishment, the world to weet\nWe stand up peerless.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nExcellent falsehood!\nWhy did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?\nI\u2019ll seem the fool I am not. Antony\nWill be himself.\n\nANTONY.\nBut stirred by Cleopatra.\nNow, for the love of Love and her soft hours,\nLet\u2019s not confound the time with conference harsh.\nThere\u2019s not a minute of our lives should stretch\nWithout some pleasure now. What sport tonight?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHear the ambassadors.\n\nANTONY.\nFie, wrangling queen!\nWhom everything becomes\u2014to chide, to laugh,\nTo weep; whose every passion fully strives\nTo make itself, in thee fair and admired!\nNo messenger but thine, and all alone\nTonight we\u2019ll wander through the streets and note\nThe qualities of people. Come, my queen,\nLast night you did desire it. Speak not to us.\n\n [_Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra with the Train._]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nIs Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?\n\nPHILO.\nSir, sometimes when he is not Antony,\nHe comes too short of that great property\nWhich still should go with Antony.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI am full sorry\nThat he approves the common liar who\nThus speaks of him at Rome, but I will hope\nOf better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Alexandria. Another Room in Cleopatra\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Enobarbus, a Soothsayer, Charmian, Iras, Mardian and Alexas.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nLord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute\nAlexas, where\u2019s the soothsayer that you praised so to th\u2019 queen? O,\nthat I knew this husband which you say must charge his horns with\ngarlands!\n\nALEXAS.\nSoothsayer!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYour will?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIs this the man? Is\u2019t you, sir, that know things?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nIn nature\u2019s infinite book of secrecy\nA little I can read.\n\nALEXAS.\nShow him your hand.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBring in the banquet quickly; wine enough\nCleopatra\u2019s health to drink.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood, sir, give me good fortune.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nI make not, but foresee.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nPray, then, foresee me one.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall be yet far fairer than you are.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHe means in flesh.\n\nIRAS.\nNo, you shall paint when you are old.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nWrinkles forbid!\n\nALEXAS.\nVex not his prescience. Be attentive.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHush!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall be more beloving than beloved.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nI had rather heat my liver with drinking.\n\nALEXAS.\nNay, hear him.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a\nforenoon and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom\nHerod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar,\nand companion me with my mistress.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall outlive the lady whom you serve.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO, excellent! I love long life better than figs.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou have seen and proved a fairer former fortune\nThan that which is to approach.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nThen belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and\nwenches must I have?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nIf every of your wishes had a womb,\nAnd fertile every wish, a million.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nOut, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.\n\nALEXAS.\nYou think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNay, come, tell Iras hers.\n\nALEXAS.\nWe\u2019ll know all our fortunes.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nMine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to bed.\n\nIRAS.\nThere\u2019s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nE\u2019en as the o\u2019erflowing Nilus presageth famine.\n\nIRAS.\nGo, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot\nscratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but workaday fortune.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYour fortunes are alike.\n\nIRAS.\nBut how, but how? give me particulars.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nI have said.\n\nIRAS.\nAm I not an inch of fortune better than she?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nWell, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you\nchoose it?\n\nIRAS.\nNot in my husband\u2019s nose.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nOur worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas\u2014come, his fortune! his\nfortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech\nthee, and let her die too, and give him a worse, and let worse follow\nworse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave,\nfiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny\nme a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!\n\nIRAS.\nAmen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a\nheartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly\nsorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep\ndecorum and fortune him accordingly!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nAmen.\n\nALEXAS.\nLo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make\nthemselves whores but they\u2019d do\u2019t!\n\n Enter Cleopatra.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHush, Here comes Antony.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNot he, the queen.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSaw you my lord?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo, lady.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWas he not here?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNo, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden\nA Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nMadam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSeek him and bring him hither. Where\u2019s Alexas?\n\nALEXAS.\nHere, at your service. My lord approaches.\n\n Enter Antony with a Messenger.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWe will not look upon him. Go with us.\n\n [_Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas and\n Soothsayer._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife first came into the field.\n\nANTONY.\nAgainst my brother Lucius.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAy.\nBut soon that war had end, and the time\u2019s state\nMade friends of them, jointing their force \u2019gainst Caesar,\nWhose better issue in the war from Italy\nUpon the first encounter drave them.\n\nANTONY.\nWell, what worst?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe nature of bad news infects the teller.\n\nANTONY.\nWhen it concerns the fool or coward. On.\nThings that are past are done with me. \u2019Tis thus:\nWho tells me true, though in his tale lie death,\nI hear him as he flattered.\n\nMESSENGER.\nLabienus\u2014\nThis is stiff news\u2014hath with his Parthian force\nExtended Asia from Euphrates\nHis conquering banner shook from Syria\nTo Lydia and to Ionia,\nWhilst\u2014\n\nANTONY.\n\u201cAntony\u201d, thou wouldst say\u2014\n\nMESSENGER.\nO, my lord!\n\nANTONY.\nSpeak to me home; mince not the general tongue.\nName Cleopatra as she is called in Rome;\nRail thou in Fulvia\u2019s phrase, and taunt my faults\nWith such full licence as both truth and malice\nHave power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds\nWhen our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us\nIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAt your noble pleasure.\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\n Enter another Messenger.\n\nANTONY.\nFrom Sicyon, ho, the news? Speak there!\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nThe man from Sicyon\u2014\n\nANTONY.\nIs there such a one?\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nHe stays upon your will.\n\nANTONY.\nLet him appear.\n\n [_Exit second Messenger._]\n\nThese strong Egyptian fetters I must break,\nOr lose myself in dotage.\n\n Enter another Messenger with a letter.\n\nWhat are you?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife is dead.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere died she?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nIn Sicyon:\nHer length of sickness, with what else more serious\nImporteth thee to know, this bears.\n\n [_Gives a letter._]\n\nANTONY.\nForbear me.\n\n [_Exit third Messenger._]\n\nThere\u2019s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.\nWhat our contempts doth often hurl from us,\nWe wish it ours again. The present pleasure,\nBy revolution lowering, does become\nThe opposite of itself. She\u2019s good, being gone.\nThe hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.\nI must from this enchanting queen break off.\nTen thousand harms, more than the ills I know,\nMy idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!\n\n Enter Enobarbus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat\u2019s your pleasure, sir?\n\nANTONY.\nI must with haste from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to\nthem. If they suffer our departure, death\u2019s the word.\n\nANTONY.\nI must be gone.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUnder a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them\naway for nothing, though, between them and a great cause they should be\nesteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies\ninstantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I\ndo think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon\nher, she hath such a celerity in dying.\n\nANTONY.\nShe is cunning past man\u2019s thought.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAlack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of\npure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they\nare greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot\nbe cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as\nJove.\n\nANTONY.\nWould I had never seen her!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nO, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not\nto have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSir?\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nFulvia?\n\nANTONY.\nDead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their\ndeities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors\nof the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out,\nthere are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia,\nthen had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is\ncrowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat:\nand indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.\n\nANTONY.\nThe business she hath broached in the state\nCannot endure my absence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd the business you have broached here cannot be without you,\nespecially that of Cleopatra\u2019s, which wholly depends on your abode.\n\nANTONY.\nNo more light answers. Let our officers\nHave notice what we purpose. I shall break\nThe cause of our expedience to the Queen,\nAnd get her leave to part. For not alone\nThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,\nDo strongly speak to us, but the letters too\nOf many our contriving friends in Rome\nPetition us at home. Sextus Pompeius\nHath given the dare to Caesar, and commands\nThe empire of the sea. Our slippery people,\nWhose love is never linked to the deserver\nTill his deserts are past, begin to throw\nPompey the Great and all his dignities\nUpon his son, who, high in name and power,\nHigher than both in blood and life, stands up\nFor the main soldier; whose quality, going on,\nThe sides o\u2019 th\u2019 world may danger. Much is breeding\nWhich, like the courser\u2019s hair, hath yet but life\nAnd not a serpent\u2019s poison. Say our pleasure\nTo such whose place is under us, requires\nOur quick remove from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall do\u2019t.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere is he?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nI did not see him since.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSee where he is, who\u2019s with him, what he does.\nI did not send you. If you find him sad,\nSay I am dancing; if in mirth, report\nThat I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.\n\n [_Exit Alexas._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,\nYou do not hold the method to enforce\nThe like from him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat should I do I do not?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIn each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nTempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear.\nIn time we hate that which we often fear.\nBut here comes Antony.\n\n Enter Antony.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am sick and sullen.\n\nANTONY.\nI am sorry to give breathing to my purpose\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHelp me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.\nIt cannot be thus long; the sides of nature\nWill not sustain it.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, my dearest queen\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPray you, stand farther from me.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI know by that same eye there\u2019s some good news.\nWhat, says the married woman you may go?\nWould she had never given you leave to come!\nLet her not say \u2019tis I that keep you here.\nI have no power upon you; hers you are.\n\nANTONY.\nThe gods best know\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, never was there queen\nSo mightily betrayed! Yet at the first\nI saw the treasons planted.\n\nANTONY.\nCleopatra\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy should I think you can be mine and true,\nThough you in swearing shake the throned gods,\nWho have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,\nTo be entangled with those mouth-made vows\nWhich break themselves in swearing!\n\nANTONY.\nMost sweet queen\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, pray you seek no colour for your going,\nBut bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,\nThen was the time for words. No going then,\nEternity was in our lips and eyes,\nBliss in our brows\u2019 bent; none our parts so poor\nBut was a race of heaven. They are so still,\nOr thou, the greatest soldier of the world,\nArt turned the greatest liar.\n\nANTONY.\nHow now, lady!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know\nThere were a heart in Egypt.\n\nANTONY.\nHear me, queen:\nThe strong necessity of time commands\nOur services awhile, but my full heart\nRemains in use with you. Our Italy\nShines o\u2019er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius\nMakes his approaches to the port of Rome;\nEquality of two domestic powers\nBreed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,\nAre newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,\nRich in his father\u2019s honour, creeps apace\nInto the hearts of such as have not thrived\nUpon the present state, whose numbers threaten;\nAnd quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge\nBy any desperate change. My more particular,\nAnd that which most with you should safe my going,\nIs Fulvia\u2019s death.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThough age from folly could not give me freedom,\nIt does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?\n\nANTONY.\nShe\u2019s dead, my queen.\nLook here, and at thy sovereign leisure read\nThe garboils she awaked; at the last, best,\nSee when and where she died.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO most false love!\nWhere be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill\nWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,\nIn Fulvia\u2019s death how mine received shall be.\n\nANTONY.\nQuarrel no more, but be prepared to know\nThe purposes I bear; which are, or cease,\nAs you shall give th\u2019 advice. By the fire\nThat quickens Nilus\u2019 slime, I go from hence\nThy soldier, servant, making peace or war\nAs thou affects.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCut my lace, Charmian, come!\nBut let it be; I am quickly ill and well,\nSo Antony loves.\n\nANTONY.\nMy precious queen, forbear,\nAnd give true evidence to his love, which stands\nAn honourable trial.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSo Fulvia told me.\nI prithee, turn aside and weep for her,\nThen bid adieu to me, and say the tears\nBelong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene\nOf excellent dissembling, and let it look\nLike perfect honour.\n\nANTONY.\nYou\u2019ll heat my blood. No more.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYou can do better yet, but this is meetly.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, by my sword\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd target. Still he mends.\nBut this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,\nHow this Herculean Roman does become\nThe carriage of his chafe.\n\nANTONY.\nI\u2019ll leave you, lady.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCourteous lord, one word.\nSir, you and I must part, but that\u2019s not it;\nSir, you and I have loved, but there\u2019s not it;\nThat you know well. Something it is I would\u2014\nO, my oblivion is a very Antony,\nAnd I am all forgotten.\n\nANTONY.\nBut that your royalty\nHolds idleness your subject, I should take you\nFor idleness itself.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\n\u2019Tis sweating labour\nTo bear such idleness so near the heart\nAs Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,\nSince my becomings kill me when they do not\nEye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;\nTherefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,\nAnd all the gods go with you! Upon your sword\nSit laurel victory, and smooth success\nBe strewed before your feet!\n\nANTONY.\nLet us go. Come.\nOur separation so abides and flies\nThat thou, residing here, goes yet with me,\nAnd I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.\nAway!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Rome. An Apartment in Caesar\u2019s House.\n\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\nIt is not Caesar\u2019s natural vice to hate\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\nThat all men follow.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nI must not think there are\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\nMore fiery by night\u2019s blackness; hereditary\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\nThan what he chooses.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou are too indulgent. Let\u2019s grant it is not\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him\u2014\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\nWhom these things cannot blemish\u2014yet must Antony\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\nCall on him for\u2019t. But to confound such time\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\nAs his own state and ours, \u2019tis to be chid\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHere\u2019s more news.\n\nMESSENGER.\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\nHow \u2019tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\nThe discontents repair, and men\u2019s reports\nGive him much wronged.\n\nCAESAR.\nI should have known no less.\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\nAnd the ebbed man, ne\u2019er loved till ne\u2019er worth love,\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\nTo rot itself with motion.\n\n Enter a second Messenger.\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nCaesar, I bring thee word\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\nThey make in Italy\u2014the borders maritime\nLack blood to think on\u2019t\u2014and flush youth revolt.\nNo vessel can peep forth but \u2019tis as soon\nTaken as seen; for Pompey\u2019s name strikes more\nThan could his war resisted.\n\nCAESAR.\nAntony,\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew\u2019st\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought\u2019st against,\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this\u2014\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now\u2014\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\nSo much as lanked not.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n\u2019Tis pity of him.\n\nCAESAR.\nLet his shames quickly\nDrive him to Rome. \u2019Tis time we twain\nDid show ourselves i\u2019 th\u2019 field, and to that end\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\nThrives in our idleness.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTomorrow, Caesar,\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\nTo front this present time.\n\nCAESAR.\nTill which encounter\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nFarewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime\nOf stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,\nTo let me be partaker.\n\nCAESAR.\nDoubt not, sir.\nI knew it for my bond.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Alexandria.

I take no pleasure\nIn aught an eunuch has. \u2019Tis well for thee\nThat, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts\nMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?\n\nMARDIAN.\nYes, gracious madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIndeed?\n\nMARDIAN.\nNot in deed, madam, for I can do nothing\nBut what indeed is honest to be done.\nYet have I fierce affections, and think\nWhat Venus did with Mars.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, Charmian,\nWhere think\u2019st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?\nOr does he walk? Or is he on his horse?\nO happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\nDo bravely, horse, for wot\u2019st thou whom thou mov\u2019st?\nThe demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\nAnd burgonet of men. He\u2019s speaking now,\nOr murmuring \u201cWhere\u2019s my serpent of old Nile?\u201d\nFor so he calls me. Now I feed myself\nWith most delicious poison. Think on me\nThat am with Ph\u0153bus\u2019 amorous pinches black,\nAnd wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\nWhen thou wast here above the ground, I was\nA morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey\nWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;\nThere would he anchor his aspect, and die\nWith looking on his life.\n\n Enter Alexas.\n\nALEXAS.\nSovereign of Egypt, hail!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHow much unlike art thou Mark Antony!\nYet, coming from him, that great medicine hath\nWith his tinct gilded thee.\nHow goes it with my brave Mark Antony?\n\nALEXAS.\nLast thing he did, dear queen,\nHe kissed\u2014the last of many doubled kisses\u2014\nThis orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMine ear must pluck it thence.\n\nALEXAS.\n\u201cGood friend,\u201d quoth he,\n\u201cSay, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends\nThis treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,\nTo mend the petty present, I will piece\nHer opulent throne with kingdoms. All the east,\nSay thou, shall call her mistress.\u201d So he nodded\nAnd soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,\nWho neighed so high that what I would have spoke\nWas beastly dumbed by him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, was he sad or merry?\n\nALEXAS.\nLike to the time o\u2019 th\u2019 year between the extremes\nOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO well-divided disposition!\u2014Note him,\nNote him, good Charmian, \u2019tis the man; but note him:\nHe was not sad, for he would shine on those\nThat make their looks by his; he was not merry,\nWhich seemed to tell them his remembrance lay\nIn Egypt with his joy; but between both.\nO heavenly mingle!\u2014Be\u2019st thou sad or merry,\nThe violence of either thee becomes,\nSo does it no man else.\u2014Met\u2019st thou my posts?\n\nALEXAS.\nAy, madam, twenty several messengers.\nWhy do you send so thick?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWho\u2019s born that day\nWhen I forget to send to Antony\nShall die a beggar.\u2014Ink and paper, Charmian.\u2014\nWelcome, my good Alexas.\u2014Did I, Charmian,\nEver love Caesar so?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO that brave Caesar!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBe choked with such another emphasis!\nSay \u201cthe brave Antony.\u201d\n\nCHARMIAN.\nThe valiant Caesar!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBy Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth\nIf thou with Caesar paragon again\nMy man of men.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nBy your most gracious pardon,\nI sing but after you.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy salad days,\nWhen I was green in judgment, cold in blood,\nTo say as I said then.

A Room in Pompey\u2019s house.\n\n Enter Pompey, Menecrates and Menas in warlike manner.\n\nPOMPEY.\nIf the great gods be just, they shall assist\nThe deeds of justest men.\n\nMENECRATES.\nKnow, worthy Pompey,\nThat what they do delay they not deny.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhiles we are suitors to their throne, decays\nThe thing we sue for.\n\nMENECRATES.\nWe, ignorant of ourselves,\nBeg often our own harms, which the wise powers\nDeny us for our good; so find we profit\nBy losing of our prayers.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI shall do well.\nThe people love me, and the sea is mine;\nMy powers are crescent, and my auguring hope\nSays it will come to th\u2019 full. Mark Antony\nIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will make\nNo wars without doors. Caesar gets money where\nHe loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,\nOf both is flattered; but he neither loves\nNor either cares for him.\n\nMENAS.\nCaesar and Lepidus\nAre in the field. A mighty strength they carry.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhere have you this? \u2019Tis false.\n\nMENAS.\nFrom Silvius, sir.\n\nPOMPEY.\nHe dreams. I know they are in Rome together,\nLooking for Antony. But all the charms of love,\nSalt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!\nLet witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;\nTie up the libertine in a field of feasts;\nKeep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks\nSharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,\nThat sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour\nEven till a Lethe\u2019d dullness\u2014\n\n Enter Varrius.\n\nHow now, Varrius!\n\nVARRIUS.\nThis is most certain that I shall deliver:\nMark Antony is every hour in Rome\nExpected. Since he went from Egypt \u2019tis\nA space for farther travel.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI could have given less matter\nA better ear.\u2014Menas, I did not think\nThis amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm\nFor such a petty war. His soldiership\nIs twice the other twain. But let us rear\nThe higher our opinion, that our stirring\nCan from the lap of Egypt\u2019s widow pluck\nThe ne\u2019er lust-wearied Antony.\n\nMENAS.\nI cannot hope\nCaesar and Antony shall well greet together.\nHis wife that\u2019s dead did trespasses to Caesar;\nHis brother warred upon him, although I think,\nNot moved by Antony.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI know not, Menas,\nHow lesser enmities may give way to greater.\nWere\u2019t not that we stand up against them all,\n\u2019Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,\nFor they have entertained cause enough\nTo draw their swords. But how the fear of us\nMay cement their divisions, and bind up\nThe petty difference, we yet not know.\nBe\u2019t as our gods will have\u2019t! It only stands\nOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.\nCome, Menas.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rome. A Room in the House of Lepidus.\n\n Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nGood Enobarbus, \u2019tis a worthy deed,\nAnd shall become you well, to entreat your captain\nTo soft and gentle speech.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall entreat him\nTo answer like himself. If Caesar move him,\nLet Antony look over Caesar\u2019s head\nAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,\nWere I the wearer of Antonius\u2019 beard,\nI would not shave\u2019t today.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n\u2019Tis not a time\nFor private stomaching.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nEvery time\nServes for the matter that is then born in\u2019t.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nBut small to greater matters must give way.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot if the small come first.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour speech is passion;\nBut pray you stir no embers up. Here comes\nThe noble Antony.\n\n Enter Antony and Ventidius.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd yonder Caesar.\n\n Enter Caesar, Maecenas and Agrippa.\n\nANTONY.\nIf we compose well here, to Parthia.\nHark, Ventidius.\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble friends,\nThat which combined us was most great, and let not\nA leaner action rend us. What\u2019s amiss,\nMay it be gently heard. When we debate\nOur trivial difference loud, we do commit\nMurder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,\nThe rather for I earnestly beseech,\nTouch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,\nNor curstness grow to th\u2019 matter.\n\nANTONY.\n\u2019Tis spoken well.\nWere we before our armies, and to fight,\nI should do thus.\n\nCAESAR.\nWelcome to Rome.\n\nANTONY.\nThank you.\n\nCAESAR.\nSit.\n\nANTONY.\nSit, sir.\n\nCAESAR.\nNay, then.\n\nANTONY.\nI learn you take things ill which are not so,\nOr being, concern you not.\n\nCAESAR.\nI must be laughed at\nIf, or for nothing or a little, I\nShould say myself offended, and with you\nChiefly i\u2019 th\u2019 world; more laughed at that I should\nOnce name you derogately when to sound your name\nIt not concerned me.\n\nANTONY.\nMy being in Egypt, Caesar,\nWhat was\u2019t to you?\n\nCAESAR.\nNo more than my residing here at Rome\nMight be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there\nDid practise on my state, your being in Egypt\nMight be my question.\n\nANTONY.\nHow intend you, practised?\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may be pleased to catch at mine intent\nBy what did here befall me. Your wife and brother\nMade wars upon me, and their contestation\nWas theme for you; you were the word of war.\n\nANTONY.\nYou do mistake your business. My brother never\nDid urge me in his act. I did inquire it,\nAnd have my learning from some true reports\nThat drew their swords with you. Did he not rather\nDiscredit my authority with yours,\nAnd make the wars alike against my stomach,\nHaving alike your cause? Of this my letters\nBefore did satisfy you. If you\u2019ll patch a quarrel,\nAs matter whole you have not to make it with,\nIt must not be with this.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou praise yourself\nBy laying defects of judgment to me; but\nYou patched up your excuses.\n\nANTONY.\nNot so, not so.\nI know you could not lack\u2014I am certain on\u2019t\u2014\nVery necessity of this thought, that I,\nYour partner in the cause \u2019gainst which he fought,\nCould not with graceful eyes attend those wars\nWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,\nI would you had her spirit in such another.\nThe third o\u2019 th\u2019 world is yours, which with a snaffle\nYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWould we had all such wives, that the men\nMight go to wars with the women.\n\nANTONY.\nSo much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,\nMade out of her impatience\u2014which not wanted\nShrewdness of policy too\u2014I grieving grant\nDid you too much disquiet. For that you must\nBut say I could not help it.\n\nCAESAR.\nI wrote to you\nWhen rioting in Alexandria; you\nDid pocket up my letters, and with taunts\nDid gibe my missive out of audience.\n\nANTONY.\nSir,\nHe fell upon me ere admitted, then.\nThree kings I had newly feasted, and did want\nOf what I was i\u2019 th\u2019 morning. But next day\nI told him of myself, which was as much\nAs to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow\nBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,\nOut of our question wipe him.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou have broken\nThe article of your oath, which you shall never\nHave tongue to charge me with.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nSoft, Caesar!\n\nANTONY.\nNo, Lepidus, let him speak.\nThe honour is sacred which he talks on now,\nSupposing that I lacked it. But on, Caesar:\nThe article of my oath?\n\nCAESAR.\nTo lend me arms and aid when I required them,\nThe which you both denied.\n\nANTONY.\nNeglected, rather;\nAnd then when poisoned hours had bound me up\nFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may\nI\u2019ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty\nShall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\nWork without it. Truth is that Fulvia,\nTo have me out of Egypt, made wars here,\nFor which myself, the ignorant motive, do\nSo far ask pardon as befits mine honour\nTo stoop in such a case.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n\u2019Tis noble spoken.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf it might please you to enforce no further\nThe griefs between ye; to forget them quite\nWere to remember that the present need\nSpeaks to atone you.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWorthily spoken, Maecenas.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nOr, if you borrow one another\u2019s love for the instant, you may, when you\nhear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to\nwrangle in when you have nothing else to do.\n\nANTONY.\nThou art a soldier only. Speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThat truth should be silent I had almost forgot.\n\nANTONY.\nYou wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nGo to, then. Your considerate stone!\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not much dislike the matter, but\nThe manner of his speech; for\u2019t cannot be\nWe shall remain in friendship, our conditions\nSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knew\nWhat hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge\nO\u2019 th\u2019 world I would pursue it.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGive me leave, Caesar.\n\nCAESAR.\nSpeak, Agrippa.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThou hast a sister by the mother\u2019s side,\nAdmired Octavia. Great Mark Antony\nIs now a widower.\n\nCAESAR.\nSay not so, Agrippa.\nIf Cleopatra heard you, your reproof\nWere well deserved of rashness.\n\nANTONY.\nI am not married, Caesar. Let me hear\nAgrippa further speak.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nTo hold you in perpetual amity,\nTo make you brothers, and to knit your hearts\nWith an unslipping knot, take Antony\nOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claims\nNo worse a husband than the best of men;\nWhose virtue and whose general graces speak\nThat which none else can utter. By this marriage\nAll little jealousies, which now seem great,\nAnd all great fears, which now import their dangers,\nWould then be nothing. Truths would be tales,\nWhere now half-tales be truths. Her love to both\nWould each to other, and all loves to both,\nDraw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,\nFor \u2019tis a studied, not a present thought,\nBy duty ruminated.\n\nANTONY.\nWill Caesar speak?\n\nCAESAR.\nNot till he hears how Antony is touched\nWith what is spoke already.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat power is in Agrippa,\nIf I would say \u201cAgrippa, be it so,\u201d\nTo make this good?\n\nCAESAR.\nThe power of Caesar, and\nHis power unto Octavia.\n\nANTONY.\nMay I never\nTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\nDream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.\nFurther this act of grace; and from this hour\nThe heart of brothers govern in our loves\nAnd sway our great designs!\n\nCAESAR.\nThere\u2019s my hand.\nA sister I bequeath you, whom no brother\nDid ever love so dearly. Let her live\nTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never\nFly off our loves again!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHappily, amen!\n\nANTONY.\nI did not think to draw my sword \u2019gainst Pompey,\nFor he hath laid strange courtesies and great\nOf late upon me. I must thank him only,\nLest my remembrance suffer ill report;\nAt heel of that, defy him.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTime calls upon \u2019s.\nOf us must Pompey presently be sought,\nOr else he seeks out us.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere lies he?\n\nCAESAR.\nAbout the Mount Misena.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat is his strength by land?\n\nCAESAR.\nGreat and increasing; but by sea\nHe is an absolute master.\n\nANTONY.\nSo is the fame.\nWould we had spoke together! Haste we for it.\nYet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\nThe business we have talked of.\n\nCAESAR.\nWith most gladness,\nAnd do invite you to my sister\u2019s view,\nWhither straight I\u2019ll lead you.\n\nANTONY.\nLet us, Lepidus, not lack your company.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble Antony, not sickness should detain me.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt all except Enobarbus, Agrippa and Maecenas._]\n\nMAECENAS.\nWelcome from Egypt, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHalf the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend,\nAgrippa!\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGood Enobarbus!\n\nMAECENAS.\nWe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed\nwell by \u2019t in Egypt.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAy, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light\nwith drinking.\n\nMAECENAS.\nEight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons\nthere. Is this true?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThis was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of\nfeast, which worthily deserved noting.\n\nMAECENAS.\nShe\u2019s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhen she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river\nof Cydnus.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThere she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI will tell you.\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,\nBurned on the water. The poop was beaten gold;\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\nThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\nIt beggared all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,\nO\u2019erpicturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature. On each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nO, rare for Antony!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHer gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\nSo many mermaids, tended her i\u2019 th\u2019 eyes,\nAnd made their bends adornings. At the helm\nA seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle\nSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands\nThat yarely frame the office. From the barge\nA strange invisible perfume hits the sense\nOf the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\nHer people out upon her, and Antony,\nEnthroned i\u2019 th\u2019 market-place, did sit alone,\nWhistling to th\u2019 air, which, but for vacancy,\nHad gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\nAnd made a gap in nature.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRare Egyptian!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUpon her landing, Antony sent to her,\nInvited her to supper. She replied\nIt should be better he became her guest,\nWhich she entreated. Our courteous Antony,\nWhom ne\u2019er the word of \u201cNo\u201d woman heard speak,\nBeing barbered ten times o\u2019er, goes to the feast,\nAnd, for his ordinary, pays his heart\nFor what his eyes eat only.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRoyal wench!\nShe made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.\nHe ploughed her, and she cropped.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI saw her once\nHop forty paces through the public street\nAnd, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,\nThat she did make defect perfection,\nAnd, breathless, pour breath forth.\n\nMAECENAS.\nNow Antony must leave her utterly.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNever. He will not.\nAge cannot wither her, nor custom stale\nHer infinite variety. Other women cloy\nThe appetites they feed, but she makes hungry\nWhere most she satisfies. For vilest things\nBecome themselves in her, that the holy priests\nBless her when she is riggish.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle\nThe heart of Antony, Octavia is\nA blessed lottery to him.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nLet us go.\nGood Enobarbus, make yourself my guest\nWhilst you abide here.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHumbly, sir, I thank you.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III.

Therefore\nMake space enough between you.\n\nANTONY.\nSpeak this no more.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nTo none but thee; no more but when to thee.\nIf thou dost play with him at any game,\nThou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck\nHe beats thee \u2019gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens\nWhen he shines by. I say again, thy spirit\nIs all afraid to govern thee near him;\nBut, he away, \u2019tis noble.\n\nANTONY.\nGet thee gone.\nSay to Ventidius I would speak with him.\n\n [_Exit Soothsayer._]\n\nHe shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,\nHe hath spoken true. The very dice obey him,\nAnd in our sports my better cunning faints\nUnder his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;\nHis cocks do win the battle still of mine\nWhen it is all to naught, and his quails ever\nBeat mine, inhooped, at odds. I will to Egypt:\nAnd though I make this marriage for my peace,\nI\u2019 th\u2019 East my pleasure lies.\n\n Enter Ventidius.\n\nO, come, Ventidius,\nYou must to Parthia.

Let\u2019s to billiards. Come, Charmian.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMy arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAs well a woman with an eunuch played\nAs with a woman. Come, you\u2019ll play with me, sir?\n\nMARDIAN.\nAs well as I can, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd when good will is showed, though\u2019t come too short,\nThe actor may plead pardon. I\u2019ll none now.\nGive me mine angle; we\u2019ll to the river. There,\nMy music playing far off, I will betray\nTawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce\nTheir slimy jaws, and as I draw them up\nI\u2019ll think them every one an Antony,\nAnd say \u201cAh, ha! You\u2019re caught.\u201d\n\nCHARMIAN.\n\u2019Twas merry when\nYou wagered on your angling; when your diver\nDid hang a salt fish on his hook, which he\nWith fervency drew up.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat time?\u2014O times!\u2014\nI laughed him out of patience; and that night\nI laughed him into patience, and next morn,\nEre the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,\nThen put my tires and mantles on him, whilst\nI wore his sword Philippan.\n\n Enter Messenger.\n\nO! from Italy!\nRam thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,\nThat long time have been barren.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, madam\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAntony\u2019s dead! If thou say so, villain,\nThou kill\u2019st thy mistress. But well and free,\nIf thou so yield him, there is gold, and here\nMy bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings\nHave lipped, and trembled kissing.\n\nMESSENGER.\nFirst, madam, he\u2019s well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy, there\u2019s more gold.\nBut sirrah, mark, we use\nTo say the dead are well. Bring it to that,\nThe gold I give thee will I melt and pour\nDown thy ill-uttering throat.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGood madam, hear me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell, go to, I will.\nBut there\u2019s no goodness in thy face if Antony\nBe free and healthful. So tart a favour\nTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well,\nThou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes,\nNot like a formal man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nWill\u2019t please you hear me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak\u2019st.\nYet if thou say Antony lives, is well,\nOr friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\nI\u2019ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail\nRich pearls upon thee.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he\u2019s well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell said.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAnd friends with Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nTh\u2019 art an honest man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nCaesar and he are greater friends than ever.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMake thee a fortune from me.\n\nMESSENGER.\nBut yet, madam\u2014\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI do not like \u201cBut yet\u201d, it does allay\nThe good precedence. Fie upon \u201cBut yet\u201d!\n\u201cBut yet\u201d is as a gaoler to bring forth\nSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\nPour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\nThe good and bad together: he\u2019s friends with Caesar,\nIn state of health, thou say\u2019st; and, thou say\u2019st, free.\n\nMESSENGER.\nFree, madam? No. I made no such report.\nHe\u2019s bound unto Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFor what good turn?\n\nMESSENGER.\nFor the best turn i\u2019 th\u2019 bed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am pale, Charmian.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he\u2019s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe most infectious pestilence upon thee!\n\n [_Strikes him down._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nGood madam, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat say you?\n\n [_Strikes him again._]\n\nHence, horrible villain, or I\u2019ll spurn thine eyes\nLike balls before me! I\u2019ll unhair thy head!\n\n [_She hales him up and down._]\n\nThou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine,\nSmarting in ling\u2019ring pickle.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGracious madam,\nI that do bring the news made not the match.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSay \u2019tis not so, a province I will give thee,\nAnd make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst\nShall make thy peace for moving me to rage,\nAnd I will boot thee with what gift beside\nThy modesty can beg.\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe\u2019s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nRogue, thou hast lived too long.\n\n [_Draws a knife._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nNay then I\u2019ll run.\nWhat mean you, madam? I have made no fault.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood madam, keep yourself within yourself.\nThe man is innocent.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSome innocents \u2019scape not the thunderbolt.\nMelt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures\nTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again.\nThough I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHe is afeard to come.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI will not hurt him.\n\n [_Exit Charmian._]\n\nThese hands do lack nobility that they strike\nA meaner than myself, since I myself\nHave given myself the cause.\n\n Enter the Messenger again with Charmian.\n\nCome hither, sir.\nThough it be honest, it is never good\nTo bring bad news. Give to a gracious message\nAn host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell\nThemselves when they be felt.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI have done my duty.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs he married?\nI cannot hate thee worser than I do\nIf thou again say \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe\u2019s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still!\n\nMESSENGER.\nShould I lie, madam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, I would thou didst,\nSo half my Egypt were submerged and made\nA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence.\nHadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\nThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nI crave your highness\u2019 pardon.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nTake no offence that I would not offend you.\nTo punish me for what you make me do\nSeems much unequal. He\u2019s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, that his fault should make a knave of thee\nThat art not what thou\u2019rt sure of! Get thee hence!\nThe merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\nAre all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,\nAnd be undone by \u2019em!\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood your highness, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIn praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMany times, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am paid for\u2019t now.\nLead me from hence;\nI faint. O Iras, Charmian! \u2019Tis no matter.\nGo to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him\nReport the feature of Octavia, her years,\nHer inclination; let him not leave out\nThe colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.\n\n [_Exit Alexas._]\n\nLet him for ever go\u2014let him not, Charmian.\nThough he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\nThe other way \u2019s a Mars. [_To Mardian_] Bid you Alexas\nBring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,\nBut do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Near Misenum.\n\n Flourish. Enter Pompey and Menas at one door, with drum and trumpet;\n at another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa,\n with Soldiers marching.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYour hostages I have, so have you mine,\nAnd we shall talk before we fight.\n\nCAESAR.\nMost meet\nThat first we come to words, and therefore have we\nOur written purposes before us sent,\nWhich if thou hast considered, let us know\nIf \u2019twill tie up thy discontented sword\nAnd carry back to Sicily much tall youth\nThat else must perish here.\n\nPOMPEY.\nTo you all three,\nThe senators alone of this great world,\nChief factors for the gods: I do not know\nWherefore my father should revengers want,\nHaving a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,\nWho at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\nThere saw you labouring for him. What was\u2019t\nThat moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what\nMade the all-honoured, honest Roman, Brutus,\nWith the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,\nTo drench the Capitol, but that they would\nHave one man but a man? And that is it\nHath made me rig my navy, at whose burden\nThe angered ocean foams, with which I meant\nTo scour\n\nRepeat 10 to 100 words from within the text."}
