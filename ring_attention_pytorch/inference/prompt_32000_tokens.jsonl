                1\n\nFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,\nThat thereby beauty\u2019s rose might never die,\nBut as the riper should by time decease,\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\nFeed\u2019st thy light\u2019s flame with self-substantial fuel,\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\nThou that art now the world\u2019s fresh ornament,\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\nAnd, tender churl, mak\u2019st waste in niggarding:\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\n  To eat the world\u2019s due, by the grave and thee.\n\n\n                    2\n\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty\u2019s field,\nThy youth\u2019s proud livery so gazed on now,\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held:\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\nHow much more praise deserv\u2019d thy beauty\u2019s use,\nIf thou couldst answer \u2018This fair child of mine\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,\u2019\nProving his beauty by succession thine.\n  This were to be new made when thou art old,\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel\u2019st it cold.\n\n\n                    3\n\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,\nNow is the time that face should form another,\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\nFor where is she so fair whose uneared womb\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb\nOf his self-love to stop posterity?\nThou art thy mother\u2019s glass and she in thee\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime,\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\n  But if thou live remembered not to be,\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.\n\n\n                    4\n\nUnthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,\nUpon thyself thy beauty\u2019s legacy?\nNature\u2019s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\nThen beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\nProfitless usurer why dost thou use\nSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?\nFor having traffic with thyself alone,\nThou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\n  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\n  Which used lives th\u2019 executor to be.\n\n\n                    5\n\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\nWill play the tyrants to the very same,\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o\u2019er-snowed and bareness every where:\nThen were not summer\u2019s distillation left\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty\u2019s effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\n  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\n  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.\n\n\n                    6\n\nThen let not winter\u2019s ragged hand deface,\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,\nWith beauty\u2019s treasure ere it be self-killed:\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\nThat\u2019s for thyself to breed another thee,\nOr ten times happier be it ten for one,\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art,\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\n  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,\n  To be death\u2019s conquest and make worms thine heir.\n\n\n                    7\n\nLo in the orient when the gracious light\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\nServing with looks his sacred majesty,\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car,\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\nThe eyes (fore duteous) now converted are\nFrom his low tract and look another way:\n  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\n\n\n                    8\n\nMusic to hear, why hear\u2019st thou music sadly?\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\nWhy lov\u2019st thou that which thou receiv\u2019st not gladly,\nOr else receiv\u2019st with pleasure thine annoy?\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\nBy unions married do offend thine ear,\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:\nMark how one string sweet husband to another,\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\nResembling sire, and child, and happy mother,\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\n  Sings this to thee, \u2018Thou single wilt prove none\u2019.\n\n\n                    9\n\nIs it for fear to wet a widow\u2019s eye,\nThat thou consum\u2019st thyself in single life?\nAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife,\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep,\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\nBy children\u2019s eyes, her husband\u2019s shape in mind:\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\nBut beauty\u2019s waste hath in the world an end,\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it:\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\n  That on himself such murd\u2019rous shame commits.\n\n\n                    10\n\nFor shame deny that thou bear\u2019st love to any\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\nGrant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\nBut that thou none lov\u2019st is most evident:\nFor thou art so possessed with murd\u2019rous hate,\nThat \u2019gainst thyself thou stick\u2019st not to conspire,\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:\nO change thy thought, that I may change my mind,\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\nBe as thy presence is gracious and kind,\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n\n\n                    11\n\nAs fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow\u2019st,\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest,\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow\u2019st,\nThou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay,\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\nAnd threescore year would make the world away:\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\nLook whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\n\n\n                    12\n\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\nAnd sable curls all silvered o\u2019er with white:\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd\nAnd summer\u2019s green all girded up in sheaves\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow,\n  And nothing \u2019gainst Time\u2019s scythe can make defence\n  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.\n\n\n                    13\n\nO that you were your self, but love you are\nNo longer yours, than you yourself here live,\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\nFind no determination, then you were\nYourself again after yourself\u2019s decease,\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter\u2019s day\nAnd barren rage of death\u2019s eternal cold?\n  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,\n  You had a father, let your son say so.\n\n\n                    14\n\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck,\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\nBut not to tell of good, or evil luck,\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons\u2019 quality,\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert:\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,\n  Thy end is truth\u2019s and beauty\u2019s doom and date.\n\n\n                    15\n\nWhen I consider everything that grows\nHolds in perfection but a little moment.\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment.\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky:\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory.\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay,\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with Decay\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\n\n\n                    16\n\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time?\nAnd fortify yourself in your decay\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\nAnd many maiden gardens yet unset,\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\nWhich this (Time\u2019s pencil) or my pupil pen\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\nCan make you live yourself in eyes of men.\n  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\n  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.\n\n\n                    17\n\nWho will believe my verse in time to come\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts:\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\nThe age to come would say this poet lies,\nSuch heavenly touches ne\u2019er touched earthly faces.\nSo should my papers (yellowed with their age)\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet\u2019s rage,\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\n  You should live twice,\u2014in it, and in my rhyme.\n\n\n                    18\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed,\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature\u2019s changing course untrimmed:\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st,\nNor shall death brag thou wand\u2019rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st,\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\n\n                    19\n\nDevouring Time blunt thou the lion\u2019s paws,\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood,\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger\u2019s jaws,\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet\u2019st,\nAnd do whate\u2019er thou wilt swift-footed Time\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets:\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime,\nO carve not with thy hours my love\u2019s fair brow,\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,\nHim in thy course untainted do allow,\nFor beauty\u2019s pattern to succeeding men.\n  Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\n\n\n                    20\n\nA woman\u2019s face with nature\u2019s own hand painted,\nHast thou the master mistress of my passion,\nA woman\u2019s gentle heart but not acquainted\nWith shifting change as is false women\u2019s fashion,\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth,\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\nWhich steals men\u2019s eyes and women\u2019s souls amazeth.\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created,\nTill nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\n  But since she pricked thee out for women\u2019s pleasure,\n  Mine be thy love and thy love\u2019s use their treasure.\n\n\n                    21\n\nSo is it not with me as with that muse,\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\nWho heaven it self for ornament doth use,\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea\u2019s rich gems:\nWith April\u2019s first-born flowers and all things rare,\nThat heaven\u2019s air in this huge rondure hems.\nO let me true in love but truly write,\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair,\nAs any mother\u2019s child, though not so bright\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven\u2019s air:\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\n\n\n                    22\n\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\nBut when in thee time\u2019s furrows I behold,\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\nO therefore love be of thyself so wary,\nAs I not for my self, but for thee will,\nBearing thy heart which I will keep so chary\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\n  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\n  Thou gav\u2019st me thine not to give back again.\n\n\n                    23\n\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\nWhose strength\u2019s abundance weakens his own heart;\nSo I for fear of trust, forget to say,\nThe perfect ceremony of love\u2019s rite,\nAnd in mine own love\u2019s strength seem to decay,\nO\u2019ercharged with burthen of mine own love\u2019s might:\nO let my looks be then the eloquence,\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.\n  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love\u2019s fine wit.\n\n\n                    24\n\nMine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,\nThy beauty\u2019s form in table of my heart,\nMy body is the frame wherein \u2019tis held,\nAnd perspective it is best painter\u2019s art.\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\nWhich in my bosom\u2019s shop is hanging still,\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\n\n\n                    25\n\nLet those who are in favour with their stars,\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\nWhilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars\nUnlooked for joy in that I honour most;\nGreat princes\u2019 favourites their fair leaves spread,\nBut as the marigold at the sun\u2019s eye,\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\n  Then happy I that love and am beloved\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n\n\n                    26\n\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit;\nTo thee I send this written embassage\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit.\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\nIn thy soul\u2019s thought (all naked) will bestow it:\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving,\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect,\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\n\n\n                    27\n\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tired,\nBut then begins a journey in my head\nTo work my mind, when body\u2019s work\u2019s expired.\nFor then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see.\nSave that my soul\u2019s imaginary sight\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\nWhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\n  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,\n  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.\n\n\n                    28\n\nHow can I then return in happy plight\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest?\nWhen day\u2019s oppression is not eased by night,\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed.\nAnd each (though enemies to either\u2019s reign)\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\nI tell the day to please him thou art bright,\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\nSo flatter I the swart-complexioned night,\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild\u2019st the even.\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\n  And night doth nightly make grief\u2019s length seem stronger\n\n\n                    29\n\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon my self and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\nDesiring this man\u2019s art, and that man\u2019s scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least,\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate,\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\n\n                    30\n\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time\u2019s waste:\nThen can I drown an eye (unused to flow)\nFor precious friends hid in death\u2019s dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love\u2019s long since cancelled woe,\nAnd moan th\u2019 expense of many a vanished sight.\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o\u2019er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\n  But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)\n  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.\n\n\n                    31\n\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\nAnd there reigns love and all love\u2019s loving parts,\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\nHath dear religious love stol\u2019n from mine eye,\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear,\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie.\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\nThat due of many, now is thine alone.\n  Their images I loved, I view in thee,\n  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.\n\n\n                    32\n\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\nWhen that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:\nCompare them with the bett\u2019ring of the time,\nAnd though they be outstripped by every pen,\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\nO then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,\n\u2019Had my friend\u2019s Muse grown with this growing age,\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\n  Theirs for their style I\u2019ll read, his for his love\u2019.\n\n\n                    33\n\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen,\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\nKissing with golden face the meadows green;\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride,\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow,\nBut out alack, he was but one hour mine,\nThe region cloud hath masked him from me now.\n  Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,\n  Suns of the world may stain, when heaven\u2019s sun staineth.\n\n\n                    34\n\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\nTo let base clouds o\u2019ertake me in my way,\nHiding thy brav\u2019ry in their rotten smoke?\n\u2019Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief,\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss,\nTh\u2019 offender\u2019s sorrow lends but weak relief\nTo him that bears the strong offence\u2019s cross.\n  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\n  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.\n\n\n                    35\n\nNo more be grieved at that which thou hast done,\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\nMy self corrupting salving thy amiss,\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are:\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense;\nThy adverse party is thy advocate,\nAnd \u2019gainst my self a lawful plea commence:\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate,\n  That I an accessary needs must be,\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\n\n\n                    36\n\nLet me confess that we two must be twain,\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\nWhich though it alter not love\u2019s sole effect,\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love\u2019s delight.\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    37\n\nAs a decrepit father takes delight,\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\nSo I, made lame by Fortune\u2019s dearest spite\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\nOr any of these all, or all, or more\nEntitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\nI make my love engrafted to this store:\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give,\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed,\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live:\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,\n  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.\n\n\n                    38\n\nHow can my Muse want subject to invent\nWhile thou dost breathe that pour\u2019st into my verse,\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent,\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\nO give thyself the thanks if aught in me,\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight,\nFor who\u2019s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\nWhen thou thyself dost give invention light?\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate,\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\n  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\n\n\n                    39\n\nO how thy worth with manners may I sing,\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring:\nAnd what is\u2019t but mine own when I praise thee?\nEven for this, let us divided live,\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\nThat by this separation I may give:\nThat due to thee which thou deserv\u2019st alone:\nO absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\n\n\n                    40\n\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all,\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:\nThen if for my love, thou my love receivest,\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,\nBut yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest\nBy wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\nI do forgive thy robbery gentle thief\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\nAnd yet love knows it is a greater grief\nTo bear greater wrong, than hate\u2019s known injury.\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\n  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\n\n\n                    41\n\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman\u2019s son,\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\nAy me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\nAnd chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\n  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\n  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\n\n\n                    42\n\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly,\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye,\nThou dost love her, because thou know\u2019st I love her,\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\nSuff\u2019ring my friend for my sake to approve her.\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love\u2019s gain,\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss,\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross,\n  But here\u2019s the joy, my friend and I are one,\n  Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.\n\n\n                    43\n\nWhen most I wink then do mine eyes best see,\nFor all the day they view things unrespected,\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\nThen thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright\nHow would thy shadow\u2019s form, form happy show,\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\nHow would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\n\n\n                    44\n\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\nInjurious distance should not stop my way,\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay,\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\nUpon the farthest earth removed from thee,\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\nBut ah, thought kills me that I am not thought\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\nI must attend, time\u2019s leisure with my moan.\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow,\n  But heavy tears, badges of either\u2019s woe.\n\n\n                    45\n\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire,\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide,\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\nMy life being made of four, with two alone,\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.\nUntil life\u2019s composition be recured,\nBy those swift messengers returned from thee,\nWho even but now come back again assured,\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me.\n  This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,\n  I send them back again and straight grow sad.\n\n\n                    46\n\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight,\nMine eye, my heart thy picture\u2019s sight would bar,\nMy heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\nA closet never pierced with crystal eyes;\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\nTo side this title is impanelled\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,\nAnd by their verdict is determined\nThe clear eye\u2019s moiety, and the dear heart\u2019s part.\n  As thus, mine eye\u2019s due is thy outward part,\n  And my heart\u2019s right, thy inward love of heart.\n\n\n                    47\n\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other,\nWhen that mine eye is famished for a look,\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;\nWith my love\u2019s picture then my eye doth feast,\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart:\nAnother time mine eye is my heart\u2019s guest,\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part.\nSo either by thy picture or my love,\nThyself away, art present still with me,\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee.\n  Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\n  Awakes my heart, to heart\u2019s and eye\u2019s delight.\n\n\n                    48\n\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\nThat to my use it might unused stay\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\nThee have I not locked up in any chest,\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol\u2019n I fear,\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\n\n\n                    49\n\nAgainst that time (if ever that time come)\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\nCalled to that audit by advised respects,\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,\nWhen love converted from the thing it was\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part,\n  To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,\n  Since why to love, I can allege no cause.\n\n\n                    50\n\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\nWhen what I seek (my weary travel\u2019s end)\nDoth teach that case and that repose to say\n\u2019Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.\u2019\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\nHis rider loved not speed being made from thee:\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side,\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\n  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.\n\n\n                    51\n\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence,\nOf my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,\nFrom where thou art, why should I haste me thence?\nTill I return of posting is no need.\nO what excuse will my poor beast then find,\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\nThen should I spur though mounted on the wind,\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know,\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace,\nTherefore desire (of perfect\u2019st love being made)\nShall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race,\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:\n  Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\n  Towards thee I\u2019ll run, and give him leave to go.\n\n\n                    52\n\nSo am I as the rich whose blessed key,\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\nSince seldom coming in that long year set,\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\nBy new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\n  Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.\n\n\n                    53\n\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\nSince every one, hath every one, one shade,\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend:\nDescribe Adonis and the counterfeit,\nIs poorly imitated after you,\nOn Helen\u2019s cheek all art of beauty set,\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\nThe other as your bounty doth appear,\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\n  In all external grace you have some part,\n  But you like none, none you for constant heart.\n\n\n                    54\n\nO how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\nFor that sweet odour, which doth in it live:\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye,\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,\nWhen summer\u2019s breath their masked buds discloses:\nBut for their virtue only is their show,\nThey live unwooed, and unrespected fade,\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,\nOf their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:\n  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\n  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.\n\n\n                    55\n\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\nThan unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\nNor Mars his sword, nor war\u2019s quick fire shall burn:\nThe living record of your memory.\n\u2019Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity\nShall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\n  So till the judgement that yourself arise,\n  You live in this, and dwell in lovers\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n                    56\n\nSweet love renew thy force, be it not said\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\nWhich but to-day by feeding is allayed,\nTo-morrow sharpened in his former might.\nSo love be thou, although to-day thou fill\nThy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\nTo-morrow see again, and do not kill\nThe spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new,\nCome daily to the banks, that when they see:\nReturn of love, more blest may be the view.\n  Or call it winter, which being full of care,\n  Makes summer\u2019s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\n\n\n                    57\n\nBeing your slave what should I do but tend,\nUpon the hours, and times of your desire?\nI have no precious time at all to spend;\nNor services to do till you require.\nNor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,\nWhilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour,\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu.\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought,\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\nBut like a sad slave stay and think of nought\nSave where you are, how happy you make those.\n  So true a fool is love, that in your will,\n  (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.\n\n\n                    58\n\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\nOr at your hand th\u2019 account of hours to crave,\nBeing your vassal bound to stay your leisure.\nO let me suffer (being at your beck)\nTh\u2019 imprisoned absence of your liberty,\nAnd patience tame to sufferance bide each check,\nWithout accusing you of injury.\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong,\nThat you yourself may privilage your time\nTo what you will, to you it doth belong,\nYourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\n  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\n  Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\n\n\n                    59\n\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is,\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\nWhich labouring for invention bear amiss\nThe second burthen of a former child!\nO that record could with a backward look,\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\nShow me your image in some antique book,\nSince mind at first in character was done.\nThat I might see what the old world could say,\nTo this composed wonder of your frame,\nWhether we are mended, or whether better they,\nOr whether revolution be the same.\n  O sure I am the wits of former days,\n  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\n\n\n                    60\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\nNativity once in the main of light,\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\nCrooked eclipses \u2019gainst his glory fight,\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty\u2019s brow,\nFeeds on the rarities of nature\u2019s truth,\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\n  And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\n  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n\n                    61\n\nIs it thy will, thy image should keep open\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\nIs it thy spirit that thou send\u2019st from thee\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\nThe scope and tenure of thy jealousy?\nO no, thy love though much, is not so great,\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake,\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\nTo play the watchman ever for thy sake.\n  For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\n  From me far off, with others all too near.\n\n\n                    62\n\nSin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,\nAnd all my soul, and all my every part;\nAnd for this sin there is no remedy,\nIt is so grounded inward in my heart.\nMethinks no face so gracious is as mine,\nNo shape so true, no truth of such account,\nAnd for my self mine own worth do define,\nAs I all other in all worths surmount.\nBut when my glass shows me my self indeed\nbeated and chopt with tanned antiquity,\nMine own self-love quite contrary I read:\nSelf, so self-loving were iniquity.\n  \u2019Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,\n  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.\n\n\n                    63\n\nAgainst my love shall be as I am now\nWith Time\u2019s injurious hand crushed and o\u2019erworn,\nWhen hours have drained his blood and filled his brow\nWith lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn\nHath travelled on to age\u2019s steepy night,\nAnd all those beauties whereof now he\u2019s king\nAre vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\nStealing away the treasure of his spring:\nFor such a time do I now fortify\nAgainst confounding age\u2019s cruel knife,\nThat he shall never cut from memory\nMy sweet love\u2019s beauty, though my lover\u2019s life.\n  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\n  And they shall live, and he in them still green.\n\n\n                    64\n\nWhen I have seen by Time\u2019s fell hand defaced\nThe rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,\nWhen sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,\nAnd brass eternal slave to mortal rage.\nWhen I have seen the hungry ocean gain\nAdvantage on the kingdom of the shore,\nAnd the firm soil win of the watery main,\nIncreasing store with loss, and loss with store.\nWhen I have seen such interchange of State,\nOr state it self confounded, to decay,\nRuin hath taught me thus to ruminate:\nThat Time will come and take my love away.\n  This thought is as a death which cannot choose\n  But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.\n\n\n                    65\n\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\nBut sad mortality o\u2019ersways their power,\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\nO how shall summer\u2019s honey breath hold out,\nAgainst the wrackful siege of batt\u2019ring days,\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\nNor gates of steel so strong but time decays?\nO fearful meditation, where alack,\nShall Time\u2019s best jewel from Time\u2019s chest lie hid?\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\n  O none, unless this miracle have might,\n  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\n\n\n                    66\n\nTired with all these, for restful death I cry:\nAs to behold desert a beggar born,\nAnd needy nothing trimmed in jollity,\nAnd purest faith unhappily forsworn,\nAnd gilded honour shamefully misplaced,\nAnd maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\nAnd right perfection wrongfully disgraced,\nAnd strength by limping sway disabled\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\nAnd folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\nAnd simple truth miscalled simplicity,\nAnd captive good attending captain ill.\n  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\n  Save that to die, I leave my love alone.\n\n\n                    67\n\nAh wherefore with infection should he live,\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve,\nAnd lace it self with his society?\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek,\nAnd steal dead seeming of his living hue?\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek,\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\nWhy should he live, now nature bankrupt is,\nBeggared of blood to blush through lively veins,\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\nAnd proud of many, lives upon his gains?\n  O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,\n  In days long since, before these last so bad.\n\n\n                    68\n\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were born,\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow:\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\nThe right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\nTo live a second life on second head,\nEre beauty\u2019s dead fleece made another gay:\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\nWithout all ornament, it self and true,\nMaking no summer of another\u2019s green,\nRobbing no old to dress his beauty new,\n  And him as for a map doth Nature store,\n  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\n\n\n                    69\n\nThose parts of thee that the world\u2019s eye doth view,\nWant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:\nAll tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,\nUttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\nThy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,\nBut those same tongues that give thee so thine own,\nIn other accents do this praise confound\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\nAnd that in guess they measure by thy deeds,\nThen churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\n  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\n  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\n\n\n                    70\n\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\nFor slander\u2019s mark was ever yet the fair,\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\nA crow that flies in heaven\u2019s sweetest air.\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve,\nThy worth the greater being wooed of time,\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\nAnd thou present\u2019st a pure unstained prime.\nThou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\nEither not assailed, or victor being charged,\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\nTo tie up envy, evermore enlarged,\n  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\n  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\n\n\n                    71\n\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead,\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\nFrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\nNay if you read this line, remember not,\nThe hand that writ it, for I love you so,\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\nO if, I say, you look upon this verse,\nWhen I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse;\nBut let your love even with my life decay.\n  Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\n  And mock you with me after I am gone.\n\n\n                    72\n\nO lest the world should task you to recite,\nWhat merit lived in me that you should love\nAfter my death, dear love, forget me quite,\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove.\nUnless you would devise some virtuous lie,\nTo do more for me than mine own desert,\nAnd hang more praise upon deceased I,\nThan niggard truth would willingly impart:\nO lest your true love may seem false in this,\nThat you for love speak well of me untrue,\nMy name be buried where my body is,\nAnd live no more to shame nor me, nor you.\n  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\n  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\n\n\n                    73\n\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold,\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day,\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\nDeath\u2019s second self that seals up all in rest.\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\nAs the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\n  This thou perceiv\u2019st, which makes thy love more strong,\n  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\n\n\n                    74\n\nBut be contented when that fell arrest,\nWithout all bail shall carry me away,\nMy life hath in this line some interest,\nWhich for memorial still with thee shall stay.\nWhen thou reviewest this, thou dost review,\nThe very part was consecrate to thee,\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due,\nMy spirit is thine the better part of me,\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead,\nThe coward conquest of a wretch\u2019s knife,\nToo base of thee to be remembered,\n  The worth of that, is that which it contains,\n  And that is this, and this with thee remains.\n\n\n                    75\n\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\nOr as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;\nAnd for the peace of you I hold such strife\nAs \u2019twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\nNow proud as an enjoyer, and anon\nDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure,\nNow counting best to be with you alone,\nThen bettered that the world may see my pleasure,\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look,\nPossessing or pursuing no delight\nSave what is had, or must from you be took.\n  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\n  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\n\n\n                    76\n\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride?\nSo far from variation or quick change?\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\nTo new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\nO know sweet love I always write of you,\nAnd you and love are still my argument:\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\nSpending again what is already spent:\n  For as the sun is daily new and old,\n  So is my love still telling what is told.\n\n\n                    77\n\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste,\nThese vacant leaves thy mind\u2019s imprint will bear,\nAnd of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\nThe wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,\nOf mouthed graves will give thee memory,\nThou by thy dial\u2019s shady stealth mayst know,\nTime\u2019s thievish progress to eternity.\nLook what thy memory cannot contain,\nCommit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\nThose children nursed, delivered from thy brain,\nTo take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\n  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\n  Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.\n\n\n                    78\n\nSo oft have I invoked thee for my muse,\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse,\nAs every alien pen hath got my use,\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\nHave added feathers to the learned\u2019s wing,\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\nWhose influence is thine, and born of thee,\nIn others\u2019 works thou dost but mend the style,\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces graced be.\n  But thou art all my art, and dost advance\n  As high as learning, my rude ignorance.\n\n\n                    79\n\nWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\nMy verse alone had all thy gentle grace,\nBut now my gracious numbers are decayed,\nAnd my sick muse doth give an other place.\nI grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument\nDeserves the travail of a worthier pen,\nYet what of thee thy poet doth invent,\nHe robs thee of, and pays it thee again,\nHe lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,\nFrom thy behaviour, beauty doth he give\nAnd found it in thy cheek: he can afford\nNo praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\n  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\n  Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\n\n\n                    80\n\nO how I faint when I of you do write,\nKnowing a better spirit doth use your name,\nAnd in the praise thereof spends all his might,\nTo make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.\nBut since your worth, wide as the ocean is,\nThe humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\nMy saucy bark (inferior far to his)\nOn your broad main doth wilfully appear.\nYour shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\nWhilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,\nOr (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,\nHe of tall building, and of goodly pride.\n  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,\n  The worst was this: my love was my decay.\n\n\n                    81\n\nOr I shall live your epitaph to make,\nOr you survive when I in earth am rotten,\nFrom hence your memory death cannot take,\nAlthough in me each part will be forgotten.\nYour name from hence immortal life shall have,\nThough I (once gone) to all the world must die,\nThe earth can yield me but a common grave,\nWhen you entombed in men\u2019s eyes shall lie,\nYour monument shall be my gentle verse,\nWhich eyes not yet created shall o\u2019er-read,\nAnd tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\nWhen all the breathers of this world are dead,\n  You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,\n  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\n\n\n                    82\n\nI grant thou wert not married to my muse,\nAnd therefore mayst without attaint o\u2019erlook\nThe dedicated words which writers use\nOf their fair subject, blessing every book.\nThou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\nFinding thy worth a limit past my praise,\nAnd therefore art enforced to seek anew,\nSome fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\nAnd do so love, yet when they have devised,\nWhat strained touches rhetoric can lend,\nThou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,\nIn true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.\n  And their gross painting might be better used,\n  Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.\n\n\n                    83\n\nI never saw that you did painting need,\nAnd therefore to your fair no painting set,\nI found (or thought I found) you did exceed,\nThat barren tender of a poet\u2019s debt:\nAnd therefore have I slept in your report,\nThat you yourself being extant well might show,\nHow far a modern quill doth come too short,\nSpeaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\nThis silence for my sin you did impute,\nWhich shall be most my glory being dumb,\nFor I impair not beauty being mute,\nWhen others would give life, and bring a tomb.\n  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,\n  Than both your poets can in praise devise.\n\n\n                    84\n\nWho is it that says most, which can say more,\nThan this rich praise: that you alone are you,\nIn whose confine immured is the store,\nWhich should example where your equal grew.\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell,\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory,\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell,\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story.\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\nMaking his style admired every where.\n  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\n  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\n\n\n                    85\n\nMy tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,\nWhile comments of your praise richly compiled,\nReserve their character with golden quill,\nAnd precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\nI think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,\nAnd like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,\nTo every hymn that able spirit affords,\nIn polished form of well refined pen.\nHearing you praised, I say \u2019tis so, \u2019tis true,\nAnd to the most of praise add something more,\nBut that is in my thought, whose love to you\n(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,\n  Then others, for the breath of words respect,\n  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\n\n\n                    86\n\nWas it the proud full sail of his great verse,\nBound for the prize of (all too precious) you,\nThat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\nMaking their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\nWas it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\nAbove a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\nNo, neither he, nor his compeers by night\nGiving him aid, my verse astonished.\nHe nor that affable familiar ghost\nWhich nightly gulls him with intelligence,\nAs victors of my silence cannot boast,\nI was not sick of any fear from thence.\n  But when your countenance filled up his line,\n  Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.\n\n\n                    87\n\nFarewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\nAnd like enough thou know\u2019st thy estimate,\nThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:\nMy bonds in thee are all determinate.\nFor how do I hold thee but by thy granting,\nAnd for that riches where is my deserving?\nThe cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\nAnd so my patent back again is swerving.\nThyself thou gav\u2019st, thy own worth then not knowing,\nOr me to whom thou gav\u2019st it, else mistaking,\nSo thy great gift upon misprision growing,\nComes home again, on better judgement making.\n  Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,\n  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\n\n\n                    88\n\nWhen thou shalt be disposed to set me light,\nAnd place my merit in the eye of scorn,\nUpon thy side, against my self I\u2019ll fight,\nAnd prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:\nWith mine own weakness being best acquainted,\nUpon thy part I can set down a story\nOf faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:\nThat thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:\nAnd I by this will be a gainer too,\nFor bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\nThe injuries that to my self I do,\nDoing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\n  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\n  That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.\n\n\n                    89\n\nSay that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\nAnd I will comment upon that offence,\nSpeak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:\nAgainst thy reasons making no defence.\nThou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,\nTo set a form upon desired change,\nAs I\u2019ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,\nI will acquaintance strangle and look strange:\nBe absent from thy walks and in my tongue,\nThy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\nLest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,\nAnd haply of our old acquaintance tell.\n  For thee, against my self I\u2019ll vow debate,\n  For I must ne\u2019er love him whom thou dost hate.\n\n\n                    90\n\nThen hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,\nNow while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\njoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss:\nAh do not, when my heart hath \u2019scaped this sorrow,\nCome in the rearward of a conquered woe,\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\nWhen other petty griefs have done their spite,\nBut in the onset come, so shall I taste\nAt first the very worst of fortune\u2019s might.\n  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\n  Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.\n\n\n                    91\n\nSome glory in their birth, some in their skill,\nSome in their wealth, some in their body\u2019s force,\nSome in their garments though new-fangled ill:\nSome in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.\nAnd every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\nWherein it finds a joy above the rest,\nBut these particulars are not my measure,\nAll these I better in one general best.\nThy love is better than high birth to me,\nRicher than wealth, prouder than garments\u2019 costs,\nOf more delight than hawks and horses be:\nAnd having thee, of all men\u2019s pride I boast.\n  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,\n  All this away, and me most wretched make.\n\n\n                    92\n\nBut do thy worst to steal thyself away,\nFor term of life thou art assured mine,\nAnd life no longer than thy love will stay,\nFor it depends upon that love of thine.\nThen need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\nWhen in the least of them my life hath end,\nI see, a better state to me belongs\nThan that, which on thy humour doth depend.\nThou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\nSince that my life on thy revolt doth lie,\nO what a happy title do I find,\nHappy to have thy love, happy to die!\n  But what\u2019s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\n  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\n\n\n                    93\n\nSo shall I live, supposing thou art true,\nLike a deceived husband, so love\u2019s face,\nMay still seem love to me, though altered new:\nThy looks with me, thy heart in other place.\nFor there can live no hatred in thine eye,\nTherefore in that I cannot know thy change,\nIn many\u2019s looks, the false heart\u2019s history\nIs writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.\nBut heaven in thy creation did decree,\nThat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,\nWhate\u2019er thy thoughts, or thy heart\u2019s workings be,\nThy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\n  How like Eve\u2019s apple doth thy beauty grow,\n  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.\n\n\n                    94\n\nThey that have power to hurt, and will do none,\nThat do not do the thing, they most do show,\nWho moving others, are themselves as stone,\nUnmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:\nThey rightly do inherit heaven\u2019s graces,\nAnd husband nature\u2019s riches from expense,\nThey are the lords and owners of their faces,\nOthers, but stewards of their excellence:\nThe summer\u2019s flower is to the summer sweet,\nThough to it self, it only live and die,\nBut if that flower with base infection meet,\nThe basest weed outbraves his dignity:\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,\n  Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.\n\n\n                    95\n\nHow sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,\nWhich like a canker in the fragrant rose,\nDoth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\nO in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!\nThat tongue that tells the story of thy days,\n(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)\nCannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,\nNaming thy name, blesses an ill report.\nO what a mansion have those vices got,\nWhich for their habitation chose out thee,\nWhere beauty\u2019s veil doth cover every blot,\nAnd all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!\n  Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,\n  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.\n\n\n                    96\n\nSome say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,\nSome say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,\nBoth grace and faults are loved of more and less:\nThou mak\u2019st faults graces, that to thee resort:\nAs on the finger of a throned queen,\nThe basest jewel will be well esteemed:\nSo are those errors that in thee are seen,\nTo truths translated, and for true things deemed.\nHow many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\nIf like a lamb he could his looks translate!\nHow many gazers mightst thou lead away,\nIf thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    97\n\nHow like a winter hath my absence been\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\nWhat old December\u2019s bareness everywhere!\nAnd yet this time removed was summer\u2019s time,\nThe teeming autumn big with rich increase,\nBearing the wanton burden of the prime,\nLike widowed wombs after their lords\u2019 decease:\nYet this abundant issue seemed to me\nBut hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\nAnd thou away, the very birds are mute.\n  Or if they sing, \u2019tis with so dull a cheer,\n  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter\u2019s near.\n\n\n                    98\n\nFrom you have I been absent in the spring,\nWhen proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)\nHath put a spirit of youth in every thing:\nThat heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.\nYet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\nOf different flowers in odour and in hue,\nCould make me any summer\u2019s story tell:\nOr from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\nNor did I wonder at the lily\u2019s white,\nNor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,\nThey were but sweet, but figures of delight:\nDrawn after you, you pattern of all those.\n  Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,\n  As with your shadow I with these did play.\n\n\n                    99\n\nThe forward violet thus did I chide,\nSweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\nIf not from my love\u2019s breath? The purple pride\nWhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells,\nIn my love\u2019s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.\nThe lily I condemned for thy hand,\nAnd buds of marjoram had stol\u2019n thy hair,\nThe roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\nOne blushing shame, another white despair:\nA third nor red, nor white, had stol\u2019n of both,\nAnd to his robbery had annexed thy breath,\nBut for his theft in pride of all his growth\nA vengeful canker eat him up to death.\n  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\n  But sweet, or colour it had stol\u2019n from thee.\n\n\n                    100\n\nWhere art thou Muse that thou forget\u2019st so long,\nTo speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\nSpend\u2019st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\nDarkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\nReturn forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,\nIn gentle numbers time so idly spent,\nSing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,\nAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.\nRise resty Muse, my love\u2019s sweet face survey,\nIf time have any wrinkle graven there,\nIf any, be a satire to decay,\nAnd make time\u2019s spoils despised everywhere.\n  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\n  So thou prevent\u2019st his scythe, and crooked knife.\n\n\n                    101\n\nO truant Muse what shall be thy amends,\nFor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\nBoth truth and beauty on my love depends:\nSo dost thou too, and therein dignified:\nMake answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,\n\u2019Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,\nBeauty no pencil, beauty\u2019s truth to lay:\nBut best is best, if never intermixed\u2019?\nBecause he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\nExcuse not silence so, for\u2019t lies in thee,\nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb:\nAnd to be praised of ages yet to be.\n  Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,\n  To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.\n\n\n                    102\n\nMy love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,\nI love not less, though less the show appear,\nThat love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,\nThe owner\u2019s tongue doth publish every where.\nOur love was new, and then but in the spring,\nWhen I was wont to greet it with my lays,\nAs Philomel in summer\u2019s front doth sing,\nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\nNot that the summer is less pleasant now\nThan when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\nBut that wild music burthens every bough,\nAnd sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n  Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:\n  Because I would not dull you with my song.\n\n\n                    103\n\nAlack what poverty my muse brings forth,\nThat having such a scope to show her pride,\nThe argument all bare is of more worth\nThan when it hath my added praise beside.\nO blame me not if I no more can write!\nLook in your glass and there appears a face,\nThat over-goes my blunt invention quite,\nDulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\nWere it not sinful then striving to mend,\nTo mar the subject that before was well?\nFor to no other pass my verses tend,\nThan of your graces and your gifts to tell.\n  And more, much more than in my verse can sit,\n  Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.\n\n\n                    104\n\nTo me fair friend you never can be old,\nFor as you were when first your eye I eyed,\nSuch seems your beauty still: three winters cold,\nHave from the forests shook three summers\u2019 pride,\nThree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,\nIn process of the seasons have I seen,\nThree April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,\nSince first I saw you fresh which yet are green.\nAh yet doth beauty like a dial hand,\nSteal from his figure, and no pace perceived,\nSo your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand\nHath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.\n  For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,\n  Ere you were born was beauty\u2019s summer dead.\n\n\n                    105\n\nLet not my love be called idolatry,\nNor my beloved as an idol show,\nSince all alike my songs and praises be\nTo one, of one, still such, and ever so.\nKind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\nStill constant in a wondrous excellence,\nTherefore my verse to constancy confined,\nOne thing expressing, leaves out difference.\nFair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\nFair, kind, and true, varying to other words,\nAnd in this change is my invention spent,\nThree themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n  Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.\n  Which three till now, never kept seat in one.\n\n\n                    106\n\nWhen in the chronicle of wasted time,\nI see descriptions of the fairest wights,\nAnd beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\nIn praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,\nThen in the blazon of sweet beauty\u2019s best,\nOf hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\nI see their antique pen would have expressed,\nEven such a beauty as you master now.\nSo all their praises are but prophecies\nOf this our time, all you prefiguring,\nAnd for they looked but with divining eyes,\nThey had not skill enough your worth to sing:\n  For we which now behold these present days,\n  Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\n\n\n                    107\n\nNot mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,\nOf the wide world, dreaming on things to come,\nCan yet the lease of my true love control,\nSupposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\nThe mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\nAnd the sad augurs mock their own presage,\nIncertainties now crown themselves assured,\nAnd peace proclaims olives of endless age.\nNow with the drops of this most balmy time,\nMy love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\nSince spite of him I\u2019ll live in this poor rhyme,\nWhile he insults o\u2019er dull and speechless tribes.\n  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n  When tyrants\u2019 crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n\n\n                    108\n\nWhat\u2019s in the brain that ink may character,\nWhich hath not figured to thee my true spirit,\nWhat\u2019s new to speak, what now to register,\nThat may express my love, or thy dear merit?\nNothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,\nI must each day say o\u2019er the very same,\nCounting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\nEven as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\nSo that eternal love in love\u2019s fresh case,\nWeighs not the dust and injury of age,\nNor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\nBut makes antiquity for aye his page,\n  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,\n  Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n\n\n                    109\n\nO never say that I was false of heart,\nThough absence seemed my flame to qualify,\nAs easy might I from my self depart,\nAs from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\nThat is my home of love, if I have ranged,\nLike him that travels I return again,\nJust to the time, not with the time exchanged,\nSo that my self bring water for my stain,\nNever believe though in my nature reigned,\nAll frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\nThat it could so preposterously be stained,\nTo leave for nothing all thy sum of good:\n  For nothing this wide universe I call,\n  Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.\n\n\n                    110\n\nAlas \u2019tis true, I have gone here and there,\nAnd made my self a motley to the view,\nGored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\nMade old offences of affections new.\nMost true it is, that I have looked on truth\nAskance and strangely: but by all above,\nThese blenches gave my heart another youth,\nAnd worse essays proved thee my best of love.\nNow all is done, have what shall have no end,\nMine appetite I never more will grind\nOn newer proof, to try an older friend,\nA god in love, to whom I am confined.\n  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,\n  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.\n\n\n                    111\n\nO for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\nThat did not better for my life provide,\nThan public means which public manners breeds.\nThence comes it that my name receives a brand,\nAnd almost thence my nature is subdued\nTo what it works in, like the dyer\u2019s hand:\nPity me then, and wish I were renewed,\nWhilst like a willing patient I will drink,\nPotions of eisel \u2019gainst my strong infection,\nNo bitterness that I will bitter think,\nNor double penance to correct correction.\n  Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,\n  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.\n\n\n                    112\n\nYour love and pity doth th\u2019 impression fill,\nWhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,\nFor what care I who calls me well or ill,\nSo you o\u2019er-green my bad, my good allow?\nYou are my all the world, and I must strive,\nTo know my shames and praises from your tongue,\nNone else to me, nor I to none alive,\nThat my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.\nIn so profound abysm I throw all care\nOf others\u2019 voices, that my adder\u2019s sense,\nTo critic and to flatterer stopped are:\nMark how with my neglect I do dispense.\n  You are so strongly in my purpose bred,\n  That all the world besides methinks are dead.\n\n\n                    113\n\nSince I left you, mine eye is in my mind,\nAnd that which governs me to go about,\nDoth part his function, and is partly blind,\nSeems seeing, but effectually is out:\nFor it no form delivers to the heart\nOf bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,\nOf his quick objects hath the mind no part,\nNor his own vision holds what it doth catch:\nFor if it see the rud\u2019st or gentlest sight,\nThe most sweet favour or deformed\u2019st creature,\nThe mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:\nThe crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.\n  Incapable of more, replete with you,\n  My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.\n\n\n                    114\n\nOr whether doth my mind being crowned with you\nDrink up the monarch\u2019s plague this flattery?\nOr whether shall I say mine eye saith true,\nAnd that your love taught it this alchemy?\nTo make of monsters, and things indigest,\nSuch cherubins as your sweet self resemble,\nCreating every bad a perfect best\nAs fast as objects to his beams assemble:\nO \u2019tis the first, \u2019tis flattery in my seeing,\nAnd my great mind most kingly drinks it up,\nMine eye well knows what with his gust is \u2019greeing,\nAnd to his palate doth prepare the cup.\n  If it be poisoned, \u2019tis the lesser sin,\n  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.\n\n\n                    115\n\nThose lines that I before have writ do lie,\nEven those that said I could not love you dearer,\nYet then my judgement knew no reason why,\nMy most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,\nBut reckoning time, whose millioned accidents\nCreep in \u2019twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,\nTan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp\u2019st intents,\nDivert strong minds to the course of alt\u2019ring things:\nAlas why fearing of time\u2019s tyranny,\nMight I not then say \u2018Now I love you best,\u2019\nWhen I was certain o\u2019er incertainty,\nCrowning the present, doubting of the rest?\n  Love is a babe, then might I not say so\n  To give full growth to that which still doth grow.\n\n\n                    116\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments, love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\nO no, it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wand\u2019ring bark,\nWhose worth\u2019s unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove\u2019s not Time\u2019s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle\u2019s compass come,\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom:\n  If this be error and upon me proved,\n  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\n\n\n                    117\n\nAccuse me thus, that I have scanted all,\nWherein I should your great deserts repay,\nForgot upon your dearest love to call,\nWhereto all bonds do tie me day by day,\nThat I have frequent been with unknown minds,\nAnd given to time your own dear-purchased right,\nThat I have hoisted sail to all the winds\nWhich should transport me farthest from your sight.\nBook both my wilfulness and errors down,\nAnd on just proof surmise, accumulate,\nBring me within the level of your frown,\nBut shoot not at me in your wakened hate:\n  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove\n  The constancy and virtue of your love.\n\n\n                    118\n\nLike as to make our appetite more keen\nWith eager compounds we our palate urge,\nAs to prevent our maladies unseen,\nWe sicken to shun sickness when we purge.\nEven so being full of your ne\u2019er-cloying sweetness,\nTo bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\nAnd sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,\nTo be diseased ere that there was true needing.\nThus policy in love t\u2019 anticipate\nThe ills that were not, grew to faults assured,\nAnd brought to medicine a healthful state\nWhich rank of goodness would by ill be cured.\n  But thence I learn and find the lesson true,\n  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.\n\n\n                    119\n\nWhat potions have I drunk of Siren tears\nDistilled from limbecks foul as hell within,\nApplying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,\nStill losing when I saw my self to win!\nWhat wretched errors hath my heart committed,\nWhilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!\nHow have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted\nIn the distraction of this madding fever!\nO benefit of ill, now I find true\nThat better is, by evil still made better.\nAnd ruined love when it is built anew\nGrows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.\n  So I return rebuked to my content,\n  And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.\n\n\n                    120\n\nThat you were once unkind befriends me now,\nAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feel,\nNeeds must I under my transgression bow,\nUnless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.\nFor if you were by my unkindness shaken\nAs I by yours, y\u2019have passed a hell of time,\nAnd I a tyrant have no leisure taken\nTo weigh how once I suffered in your crime.\nO that our night of woe might have remembered\nMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\nAnd soon to you, as you to me then tendered\nThe humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\n  But that your trespass now becomes a fee,\n  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\n\n\n                    121\n\n\u2019Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,\nWhen not to be, receives reproach of being,\nAnd the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,\nNot by our feeling, but by others\u2019 seeing.\nFor why should others\u2019 false adulterate eyes\nGive salutation to my sportive blood?\nOr on my frailties why are frailer spies,\nWhich in their wills count bad what I think good?\nNo, I am that I am, and they that level\nAt my abuses, reckon up their own,\nI may be straight though they themselves be bevel;\nBy their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown\n  Unless this general evil they maintain,\n  All men are bad and in their badness reign.\n\n\n                    122\n\nThy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\nFull charactered with lasting memory,\nWhich shall above that idle rank remain\nBeyond all date even to eternity.\nOr at the least, so long as brain and heart\nHave faculty by nature to subsist,\nTill each to razed oblivion yield his part\nOf thee, thy record never can be missed:\nThat poor retention could not so much hold,\nNor need I tallies thy dear love to score,\nTherefore to give them from me was I bold,\nTo trust those tables that receive thee more:\n  To keep an adjunct to remember thee\n  Were to import forgetfulness in me.\n\n\n                    123\n\nNo! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,\nThy pyramids built up with newer might\nTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange,\nThey are but dressings of a former sight:\nOur dates are brief, and therefore we admire,\nWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old,\nAnd rather make them born to our desire,\nThan think that we before have heard them told:\nThy registers and thee I both defy,\nNot wond\u2019ring at the present, nor the past,\nFor thy records, and what we see doth lie,\nMade more or less by thy continual haste:\n  This I do vow and this shall ever be,\n  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\n\n\n                    124\n\nIf my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune\u2019s bastard be unfathered,\nAs subject to time\u2019s love or to time\u2019s hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.\nNo it was builded far from accident,\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th\u2019 inviting time our fashion calls:\nIt fears not policy that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-numbered hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.\n  To this I witness call the fools of time,\n  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\n\n\n                    125\n\nWere\u2019t aught to me I bore the canopy,\nWith my extern the outward honouring,\nOr laid great bases for eternity,\nWhich proves more short than waste or ruining?\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favour\nLose all, and more by paying too much rent\nFor compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,\nPitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?\nNo, let me be obsequious in thy heart,\nAnd take thou my oblation, poor but free,\nWhich is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,\nBut mutual render, only me for thee.\n  Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul\n  When most impeached, stands least in thy control.\n\n\n                    126\n\nO thou my lovely boy who in thy power,\nDost hold Time\u2019s fickle glass his fickle hour:\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show\u2019st,\nThy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow\u2019st.\nIf Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)\nAs thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\nShe keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\nMay time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.\nYet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,\nShe may detain, but not still keep her treasure!\n  Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,\n  And her quietus is to render thee.\n\n\n                    127\n\nIn the old age black was not counted fair,\nOr if it were it bore not beauty\u2019s name:\nBut now is black beauty\u2019s successive heir,\nAnd beauty slandered with a bastard shame,\nFor since each hand hath put on nature\u2019s power,\nFairing the foul with art\u2019s false borrowed face,\nSweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,\nBut is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.\nTherefore my mistress\u2019 eyes are raven black,\nHer eyes so suited, and they mourners seem\nAt such who not born fair no beauty lack,\nSlandering creation with a false esteem,\n  Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\n  That every tongue says beauty should look so.\n\n\n                    128\n\nHow oft when thou, my music, music play\u2019st,\nUpon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\nWith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway\u2019st\nThe wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\nDo I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\nTo kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\nWhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\nAt the wood\u2019s boldness by thee blushing stand.\nTo be so tickled they would change their state\nAnd situation with those dancing chips,\nO\u2019er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\nMaking dead wood more blest than living lips,\n  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,\n  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\n\n\n                    129\n\nTh\u2019 expense of spirit in a waste of shame\nIs lust in action, and till action, lust\nIs perjured, murd\u2019rous, bloody full of blame,\nSavage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,\nEnjoyed no sooner but despised straight,\nPast reason hunted, and no sooner had\nPast reason hated as a swallowed bait,\nOn purpose laid to make the taker mad.\nMad in pursuit and in possession so,\nHad, having, and in quest, to have extreme,\nA bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;\nBefore a joy proposed behind a dream.\n  All this the world well knows yet none knows well,\n  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\n\n\n                    130\n\nMy mistress\u2019 eyes are nothing like the sun,\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red,\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white,\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks,\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight,\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know,\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\nI grant I never saw a goddess go;\nMy mistress when she walks treads on the ground.\n  And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,\n  As any she belied with false compare.\n\n\n                    131\n\nThou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\nAs those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\nFor well thou know\u2019st to my dear doting heart\nThou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\nYet in good faith some say that thee behold,\nThy face hath not the power to make love groan;\nTo say they err, I dare not be so bold,\nAlthough I swear it to my self alone.\nAnd to be sure that is not false I swear,\nA thousand groans but thinking on thy face,\nOne on another\u2019s neck do witness bear\nThy black is fairest in my judgement\u2019s place.\n  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\n  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.\n\n\n                    132\n\nThine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,\nKnowing thy heart torment me with disdain,\nHave put on black, and loving mourners be,\nLooking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\nAnd truly not the morning sun of heaven\nBetter becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\nNor that full star that ushers in the even\nDoth half that glory to the sober west\nAs those two mourning eyes become thy face:\nO let it then as well beseem thy heart\nTo mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\nAnd suit thy pity like in every part.\n  Then will I swear beauty herself is black,\n  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.\n\n\n                    133\n\nBeshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan\nFor that deep wound it gives my friend and me;\nIs\u2019t not enough to torture me alone,\nBut slave to slavery my sweet\u2019st friend must be?\nMe from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,\nAnd my next self thou harder hast engrossed,\nOf him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,\nA torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:\nPrison my heart in thy steel bosom\u2019s ward,\nBut then my friend\u2019s heart let my poor heart bail,\nWhoe\u2019er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,\nThou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.\n  And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,\n  Perforce am thine and all that is in me.\n\n\n                    134\n\nSo now I have confessed that he is thine,\nAnd I my self am mortgaged to thy will,\nMy self I\u2019ll forfeit, so that other mine,\nThou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\nBut thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\nFor thou art covetous, and he is kind,\nHe learned but surety-like to write for me,\nUnder that bond that him as fist doth bind.\nThe statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\nThou usurer that put\u2019st forth all to use,\nAnd sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,\nSo him I lose through my unkind abuse.\n  Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,\n  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\n\n\n                    135\n\nWhoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,\nAnd Will to boot, and Will in overplus,\nMore than enough am I that vex thee still,\nTo thy sweet will making addition thus.\nWilt thou whose will is large and spacious,\nNot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\nShall will in others seem right gracious,\nAnd in my will no fair acceptance shine?\nThe sea all water, yet receives rain still,\nAnd in abundance addeth to his store,\nSo thou being rich in will add to thy will\nOne will of mine to make thy large will more.\n  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,\n  Think all but one, and me in that one Will.\n\n\n                    136\n\nIf thy soul check thee that I come so near,\nSwear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,\nAnd will thy soul knows is admitted there,\nThus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.\nWill will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\nAy, fill it full with wills, and my will one,\nIn things of great receipt with case we prove,\nAmong a number one is reckoned none.\nThen in the number let me pass untold,\nThough in thy store\u2019s account I one must be,\nFor nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,\nThat nothing me, a something sweet to thee.\n  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,\n  And then thou lov\u2019st me for my name is Will.\n\n\n                    137\n\nThou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\nThat they behold and see not what they see?\nThey know what beauty is, see where it lies,\nYet what the best is, take the worst to be.\nIf eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,\nBe anchored in the bay where all men ride,\nWhy of eyes\u2019 falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\nWhereto the judgement of my heart is tied?\nWhy should my heart think that a several plot,\nWhich my heart knows the wide world\u2019s common place?\nOr mine eyes seeing this, say this is not\nTo put fair truth upon so foul a face?\n  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,\n  And to this false plague are they now transferred.\n\n\n                    138\n\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth,\nI do believe, her though I know she lies,\nThat she might think me some untutored youth,\nUnlearned in the world\u2019s false subtleties.\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\nAlthough she knows my days are past the best,\nSimply I credit her false-speaking tongue;\nOn both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.\nBut wherefore says she not she is unjust?\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\nO love\u2019s best habit is in seeming trust,\nAnd age in love loves not to have years told.\n  Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,\n  And in our faults by lies we flattered be.\n\n\n                    139\n\nO call not me to justify the wrong,\nThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart,\nWound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,\nUse power with power, and slay me not by art,\nTell me thou lov\u2019st elsewhere; but in my sight,\nDear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,\nWhat need\u2019st thou wound with cunning when thy might\nIs more than my o\u2019erpressed defence can bide?\nLet me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,\nHer pretty looks have been mine enemies,\nAnd therefore from my face she turns my foes,\nThat they elsewhere might dart their injuries:\n  Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,\n  Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.\n\n\n                    140\n\nBe wise as thou art cruel, do not press\nMy tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:\nLest sorrow lend me words and words express,\nThe manner of my pity-wanting pain.\nIf I might teach thee wit better it were,\nThough not to love, yet love to tell me so,\nAs testy sick men when their deaths be near,\nNo news but health from their physicians know.\nFor if I should despair I should grow mad,\nAnd in my madness might speak ill of thee,\nNow this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,\nMad slanderers by mad ears believed be.\n  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,\n  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.\n\n\n                    141\n\nIn faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,\nFor they in thee a thousand errors note,\nBut \u2019tis my heart that loves what they despise,\nWho in despite of view is pleased to dote.\nNor are mine ears with thy tongue\u2019s tune delighted,\nNor tender feeling to base touches prone,\nNor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\nTo any sensual feast with thee alone:\nBut my five wits, nor my five senses can\nDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\nWho leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\nThy proud heart\u2019s slave and vassal wretch to be:\n  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,\n  That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.\n\n\n                    142\n\nLove is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,\nHate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,\nO but with mine, compare thou thine own state,\nAnd thou shalt find it merits not reproving,\nOr if it do, not from those lips of thine,\nThat have profaned their scarlet ornaments,\nAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,\nRobbed others\u2019 beds\u2019 revenues of their rents.\nBe it lawful I love thee as thou lov\u2019st those,\nWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,\nRoot pity in thy heart that when it grows,\nThy pity may deserve to pitied be.\n  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,\n  By self-example mayst thou be denied.\n\n\n                    143\n\nLo as a careful huswife runs to catch,\nOne of her feathered creatures broke away,\nSets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch\nIn pursuit of the thing she would have stay:\nWhilst her neglected child holds her in chase,\nCries to catch her whose busy care is bent,\nTo follow that which flies before her face:\nNot prizing her poor infant\u2019s discontent;\nSo run\u2019st thou after that which flies from thee,\nWhilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,\nBut if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:\nAnd play the mother\u2019s part, kiss me, be kind.\n  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,\n  If thou turn back and my loud crying still.\n\n\n                    144\n\nTwo loves I have, of comfort and despair,\nWhich, like two spirits, do suggest me still:\nThe better angel is a man right fair,\nThe worser spirit a woman coloured ill.\nTo win me soon to hell my female evil\nTempteth my better angel from my side,\nAnd would corrupt my saint to be a devil,\nWooing his purity with her foul pride.\nAnd whether that my angel be turned fiend\nSuspect I may, yet not directly tell;\nBut being both from me both to each friend,\nI guess one angel in another\u2019s hell.\n  Yet this shall I ne\u2019er know, but live in doubt,\n  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.\n\n\n                    145\n\nThose lips that Love\u2019s own hand did make,\nBreathed forth the sound that said \u2018I hate\u2019,\nTo me that languished for her sake:\nBut when she saw my woeful state,\nStraight in her heart did mercy come,\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet,\nWas used in giving gentle doom:\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet:\n\u2018I hate\u2019 she altered with an end,\nThat followed it as gentle day,\nDoth follow night who like a fiend\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away.\n  \u2018I hate\u2019, from hate away she threw,\n  And saved my life saying \u2018not you\u2019.\n\n\n                    146\n\nPoor soul the centre of my sinful earth,\nMy sinful earth these rebel powers array,\nWhy dost thou pine within and suffer dearth\nPainting thy outward walls so costly gay?\nWhy so large cost having so short a lease,\nDost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\nShall worms inheritors of this excess\nEat up thy charge? is this thy body\u2019s end?\nThen soul live thou upon thy servant\u2019s loss,\nAnd let that pine to aggravate thy store;\nBuy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\nWithin be fed, without be rich no more,\n  So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,\n  And death once dead, there\u2019s no more dying then.\n\n\n                    147\n\nMy love is as a fever longing still,\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nTh\u2019 uncertain sickly appetite to please:\nMy reason the physician to my love,\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve,\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest,\nMy thoughts and my discourse as mad men\u2019s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed.\n  For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\n  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.\n\n\n                    148\n\nO me! what eyes hath love put in my head,\nWhich have no correspondence with true sight,\nOr if they have, where is my judgement fled,\nThat censures falsely what they see aright?\nIf that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,\nWhat means the world to say it is not so?\nIf it be not, then love doth well denote,\nLove\u2019s eye is not so true as all men\u2019s: no,\nHow can it? O how can love\u2019s eye be true,\nThat is so vexed with watching and with tears?\nNo marvel then though I mistake my view,\nThe sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.\n  O cunning love, with tears thou keep\u2019st me blind,\n  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.\n\n\n                    149\n\nCanst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,\nWhen I against my self with thee partake?\nDo I not think on thee when I forgot\nAm of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?\nWho hateth thee that I do call my friend,\nOn whom frown\u2019st thou that I do fawn upon,\nNay if thou lour\u2019st on me do I not spend\nRevenge upon my self with present moan?\nWhat merit do I in my self respect,\nThat is so proud thy service to despise,\nWhen all my best doth worship thy defect,\nCommanded by the motion of thine eyes?\n  But love hate on for now I know thy mind,\n  Those that can see thou lov\u2019st, and I am blind.\n\n\n                    150\n\nO from what power hast thou this powerful might,\nWith insufficiency my heart to sway,\nTo make me give the lie to my true sight,\nAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?\nWhence hast thou this becoming of things ill,\nThat in the very refuse of thy deeds,\nThere is such strength and warrantise of skill,\nThat in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?\nWho taught thee how to make me love thee more,\nThe more I hear and see just cause of hate?\nO though I love what others do abhor,\nWith others thou shouldst not abhor my state.\n  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,\n  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.\n\n\n                    151\n\nLove is too young to know what conscience is,\nYet who knows not conscience is born of love?\nThen gentle cheater urge not my amiss,\nLest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.\nFor thou betraying me, I do betray\nMy nobler part to my gross body\u2019s treason,\nMy soul doth tell my body that he may,\nTriumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,\nBut rising at thy name doth point out thee,\nAs his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,\nHe is contented thy poor drudge to be,\nTo stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\n  No want of conscience hold it that I call,\n  Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.\n\n\n                    152\n\nIn loving thee thou know\u2019st I am forsworn,\nBut thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,\nIn act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,\nIn vowing new hate after new love bearing:\nBut why of two oaths\u2019 breach do I accuse thee,\nWhen I break twenty? I am perjured most,\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost.\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,\nAnd to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,\nOr made them swear against the thing they see.\n  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,\n  To swear against the truth so foul a lie.\n\n\n                    153\n\nCupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,\nA maid of Dian\u2019s this advantage found,\nAnd his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\nIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground:\nWhich borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\nA dateless lively heat still to endure,\nAnd grew a seething bath which yet men prove,\nAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure:\nBut at my mistress\u2019 eye Love\u2019s brand new-fired,\nThe boy for trial needs would touch my breast,\nI sick withal the help of bath desired,\nAnd thither hied a sad distempered guest.\n  But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,\n  Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress\u2019 eyes.\n\n\n                    154\n\nThe little Love-god lying once asleep,\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,\nCame tripping by, but in her maiden hand,\nThe fairest votary took up that fire,\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed,\nAnd so the general of hot desire,\nWas sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from Love\u2019s fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\nFor men diseased; but I, my mistress\u2019 thrall,\n  Came there for cure and this by that I prove,\n  Love\u2019s fire heats water, water cools not love.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\nALL\u2019S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\n\n\n\nContents\n\nACT I\nScene I.

Rossillon. A room in the Countess\u2019s palace.\n\n Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in\n black.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o\u2019er my father\u2019s death anew; but I must\nattend his majesty\u2019s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in\nsubjection.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He\nthat so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his\nvirtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,\nrather than lack it where there is such abundance.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat hope is there of his majesty\u2019s amendment?\n\nLAFEW.\nHe hath abandon\u2019d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath\npersecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process\nbut only the losing of hope by time.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis young gentlewoman had a father\u2014O that \u201chad!\u201d, how sad a passage\n\u2019tis!\u2014whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch\u2019d\nso far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for\nlack of work. Would for the king\u2019s sake he were living! I think it\nwould be the death of the king\u2019s disease.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be\nso: Gerard de Narbon.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him\nadmiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv\u2019d still,\nif knowledge could be set up against mortality.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\n\nLAFEW.\nA fistula, my lord.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI heard not of it before.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of\nGerard de Narbon?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those\nhopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind\ncarries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are\nvirtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\u2019Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance\nof her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows\ntakes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no\nmore, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.\n\nHELENA.\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\n\nLAFEW.\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the\nenemy to the living.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow understand we that?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\nIn manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\nDo wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy\nRather in power than use; and keep thy friend\nUnder thy own life\u2019s key. Be check\u2019d for silence,\nBut never tax\u2019d for speech. What heaven more will,\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\nFall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,\n\u2019Tis an unseason\u2019d courtier; good my lord,\nAdvise him.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe cannot want the best\nThat shall attend his love.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\n\n [_Exit Countess._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nThe best wishes that can be forg\u2019d in your thoughts be servants to you!\n[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make\nmuch of her.\n\nLAFEW.\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]\n\nHELENA.\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\nI have forgot him; my imagination\nCarries no favour in\u2019t but Bertram\u2019s.\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\nIf Bertram be away. \u2019Twere all one\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\nTh\u2019ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\nMust die for love. \u2019Twas pretty, though a plague,\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\nIn our heart\u2019s table,\u2014heart too capable\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\nBut now he\u2019s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\nYet these fix\u2019d evils sit so fit in him\nThat they take place when virtue\u2019s steely bones\nLooks bleak i\u2019 th\u2019 cold wind: withal, full oft we see\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSave you, fair queen!\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you, monarch!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNo.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd no.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAre you meditating on virginity?\n\nHELENA.\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.\nMan is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\n\nPAROLLES.\nKeep him out.\n\nHELENA.\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet\nis weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow\nyou up.\n\nHELENA.\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no\nmilitary policy how virgins might blow up men?\n\nPAROLLES.\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in\nblowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your\ncity. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve\nvirginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never\nvirgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times\nfound; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. \u2019Tis too cold a companion.\nAway with it!\n\nHELENA.\nI will stand for\u2019t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere\u2019s little can be said in\u2019t; \u2019tis against the rule of nature. To\nspeak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most\ninfallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity\nmurders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\nlimit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\nmites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\ndies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\nproud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by\u2019t. Out with\u2019t! Within\nthe year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the\nprincipal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\n\nHELENA.\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n\nPAROLLES.\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne\u2019er it likes. \u2019Tis a\ncommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less\nworth. Off with\u2019t while \u2019tis vendible; answer the time of request.\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly\nsuited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which\nwear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in\nyour cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our\nFrench wither\u2019d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, \u2019tis a\nwither\u2019d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet \u2019tis a wither\u2019d pear.\nWill you anything with it?\n\nHELENA.\nNot my virginity yet.\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he\u2014\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\nThe court\u2019s a learning-place; and he is one.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat one, i\u2019 faith?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I wish well. \u2019Tis pity\u2014\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat\u2019s pity?\n\nHELENA.\nThat wishing well had not a body in\u2019t\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\nReturns us thanks.\n\n Enter a Page.\n\nPAGE.\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\n\n [_Exit Page._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at\ncourt.\n\nHELENA.\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUnder Mars, I.\n\nHELENA.\nI especially think, under Mars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy under Mars?\n\nHELENA.\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under\nMars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhen he was predominant.\n\nHELENA.\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy think you so?\n\nHELENA.\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat\u2019s for advantage.\n\nHELENA.\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition\nthat your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and\nI like the wear well.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return\nperfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier\u2019s counsel, and understand\nwhat advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine\nunthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy\nfriends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So,\nfarewell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nHELENA.\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\nThe king\u2019s disease,\u2014my project may deceive me,\nBut my intents are fix\u2019d, and will not leave me.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Paris. A room in the King\u2019s palace.\n\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and\n others attending.\n\nKING.\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th\u2019 ears;\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\nA braving war.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSo \u2019tis reported, sir.\n\nKING.\nNay, \u2019tis most credible, we here receive it,\nA certainty, vouch\u2019d from our cousin Austria,\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\nTo have us make denial.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHis love and wisdom,\nApprov\u2019d so to your majesty, may plead\nFor amplest credence.\n\nKING.\nHe hath arm\u2019d our answer,\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\nTo stand on either part.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt well may serve\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\nFor breathing and exploit.\n\nKING.\nWhat\u2019s he comes here?\n\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\nYoung Bertram.\n\nKING.\nYouth, thou bear\u2019st thy father\u2019s face;\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\nHath well compos\u2019d thee. Thy father\u2019s moral parts\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty\u2019s.\n\nKING.\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\nInto the service of the time, and was\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\nHis equal had awak\u2019d them, and his honour,\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\nException bid him speak, and at this time\nHis tongue obey\u2019d his hand. Who were below him\nHe us\u2019d as creatures of another place,\nAnd bow\u2019d his eminent top to their low ranks,\nMaking them proud of his humility,\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\nBut goers backward.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHis good remembrance, sir,\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\nAs in your royal speech.\n\nKING.\nWould I were with him! He would always say,\u2014\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\nHe scatter\u2019d not in ears, but grafted them\nTo grow there and to bear,\u2014\u201cLet me not live,\u201d\nThis his good melancholy oft began\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\nWhen it was out,\u2014\u201cLet me not live\u201d quoth he,\n\u201cAfter my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\nExpire before their fashions.\u201d This he wish\u2019d.\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\nTo give some labourers room.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou\u2019re lov\u2019d, sir;\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\n\nKING.\nI fill a place, I know\u2019t. How long is\u2019t, Count,\nSince the physician at your father\u2019s died?\nHe was much fam\u2019d.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSome six months since, my lord.\n\nKING.\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;\u2014\nLend me an arm;\u2014the rest have worn me out\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\nMy son\u2019s no dearer.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThank your majesty.\n\n [_Exeunt. Flourish._]\n\nSCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found\nin the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty,\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\npublish them.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have\nheard of you I do not all believe; \u2019tis my slowness that I do not; for\nI know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to\nmake such knaveries yours.\n\nCLOWN.\n\u2019Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, sir.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, madam, \u2019tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are\ndamned; but if I may have your ladyship\u2019s good will to go to the world,\nIsbel the woman and I will do as we may.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\n\nCLOWN.\nI do beg your good will in this case.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn what case?\n\nCLOWN.\nIn Isbel\u2019s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I\nshall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for\nthey say barnes are blessings.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\n\nCLOWN.\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he\nmust needs go that the devil drives.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIs this all your worship\u2019s reason?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMay the world know them?\n\nCLOWN.\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood\nare; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife\u2019s\nsake.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nY\u2019are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that\nfor me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and\ngives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he\u2019s my drudge. He\nthat comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that\ncherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\nflesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my\nfriend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no\nfear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the\npapist, howsome\u2019er their hearts are sever\u2019d in religion, their heads\nare both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i\u2019 the herd.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth\u2019d and calumnious knave?\n\nCLOWN.\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\n   _For I the ballad will repeat,\n   Which men full true shall find;\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGet you gone, sir; I\u2019ll talk with you more anon.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to\nspeak.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._]\n_   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\n   Fond done, done fond,\n      Was this King Priam\u2019s joy?\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n      And gave this sentence then:\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n     There\u2019s yet one good in ten._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\n\nCLOWN.\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o\u2019 the song. Would\nGod would serve the world so all the year! We\u2019d find no fault with the\ntithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth \u2019a! And we might\nhave a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake,\n\u2019twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he\npluck one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou\u2019ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\n\nCLOWN.\nThat man should be at woman\u2019s command, and yet no hurt done! Though\nhonesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the\nsurplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,\nforsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, now.\n\nSTEWARD.\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath\u2019d her to me, and she herself, without\nother advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds;\nthere is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than\nshe\u2019ll demand.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish\u2019d me; alone\nshe was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;\nshe thought, I dare vow for her, they touch\u2019d not any stranger sense.\nHer matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess,\nthat had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god,\nthat would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana\nno queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris\u2019d,\nwithout rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she\ndeliver\u2019d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e\u2019er I heard virgin\nexclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to\nknow it.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou have discharg\u2019d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many\nlikelihoods inform\u2019d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the\nbalance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me;\nstall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will\nspeak with you further anon.\n\n [_Exit Steward._]\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\nIf ever we are nature\u2019s, these are ours; this thorn\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\nIt is the show and seal of nature\u2019s truth,\nWhere love\u2019s strong passion is impress\u2019d in youth.\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\nHer eye is sick on\u2019t; I observe her now.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou know, Helen,\nI am a mother to you.\n\nHELENA.\nMine honourable mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNay, a mother.\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\nMethought you saw a serpent. What\u2019s in mother,\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\nThat were enwombed mine. \u2019Tis often seen\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\nYou ne\u2019er oppress\u2019d me with a mother\u2019s groan,\nYet I express to you a mother\u2019s care.\nGod\u2019s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\nTo say I am thy mother? What\u2019s the matter,\nThat this distempered messenger of wet,\nThe many-colour\u2019d Iris, rounds thine eye?\n\u2014Why, that you are my daughter?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I am not.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI say, I am your mother.\n\nHELENA.\nPardon, madam;\nThe Count Rossillon cannot be my brother.\nI am from humble, he from honoured name;\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble,\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die.\nHe must not be my brother.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNor I your mother?\n\nHELENA.\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were\u2014\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,\u2014\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\nSo I were not his sister. Can\u2019t no other,\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\nSo strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?\nMy fear hath catch\u2019d your fondness; now I see\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\nYour salt tears\u2019 head. Now to all sense \u2019tis gross\nYou love my son; invention is asham\u2019d,\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\nBut tell me then, \u2019tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\nConfess it, t\u2019one to th\u2019other; and thine eyes\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is\u2019t so?\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\nIf it be not, forswear\u2019t: howe\u2019er, I charge thee,\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\nTo tell me truly.\n\nHELENA.\nGood madam, pardon me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you love my son?\n\nHELENA.\nYour pardon, noble mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nLove you my son?\n\nHELENA.\nDo not you love him, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGo not about; my love hath in\u2019t a bond\nWhereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\nHave to the full appeach\u2019d.\n\nHELENA.\nThen I confess,\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\nI love your son.\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so\u2019s my love.\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\nThat he is lov\u2019d of me; I follow him not\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\nYet never know how that desert should be.\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\nI still pour in the waters of my love\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\nReligious in mine error, I adore\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHad you not lately an intent,\u2014speak truly,\u2014\nTo go to Paris?\n\nHELENA.\nMadam, I had.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWherefore? tell true.\n\nHELENA.\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\nOf rare and prov\u2019d effects, such as his reading\nAnd manifest experience had collected\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will\u2019d me\nIn heedfull\u2019st reservation to bestow them,\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\nThere is a remedy, approv\u2019d, set down,\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\nThe king is render\u2019d lost.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis was your motive\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\n\nHELENA.\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\nHaply been absent then.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBut think you, Helen,\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\nHe would receive it? He and his physicians\nAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him;\nThey, that they cannot help. How shall they credit\nA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\nEmbowell\u2019d of their doctrine, have let off\nThe danger to itself?\n\nHELENA.\nThere\u2019s something in\u2019t\nMore than my father\u2019s skill, which was the great\u2019st\nOf his profession, that his good receipt\nShall for my legacy be sanctified\nBy th\u2019 luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour\nBut give me leave to try success, I\u2019d venture\nThe well-lost life of mine on his grace\u2019s cure.\nBy such a day, an hour.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDost thou believe\u2019t?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, madam, knowingly.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\nMeans and attendants, and my loving greetings\nTo those of mine in court. I\u2019ll stay at home,\nAnd pray God\u2019s blessing into thy attempt.\nBe gone tomorrow; and be sure of this,\nWhat I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I. Paris. A room in the King\u2019s palace.\n\n Flourish. Enter the King with young Lords taking leave for the\n Florentine war; Bertram, Parolles and Attendants.\n\nKING.\nFarewell, young lords; these warlike principles\nDo not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell;\nShare the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,\nThe gift doth stretch itself as \u2019tis receiv\u2019d,\nAnd is enough for both.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n\u2019Tis our hope, sir,\nAfter well-ent\u2019red soldiers, to return\nAnd find your grace in health.\n\nKING.\nNo, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart\nWill not confess he owes the malady\nThat doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,\u2014\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\nOf the last monarchy\u2014see that you come\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\n\nKING.\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\nThey say our French lack language to deny\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\nBefore you serve.\n\nBOTH.\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\n\nKING.\nFarewell.\u2014Come hither to me.\n\n [_The King retires to a couch._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\n\nPAROLLES.\n\u2019Tis not his fault; the spark.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, \u2019tis brave wars!\n\nPAROLLES.\nMost admirable! I have seen those wars.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI am commanded here, and kept a coil with,\n\u201cToo young\u201d, and \u201cthe next year\u201d and \u201c\u2019tis too early\u201d.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAn thy mind stand to\u2019t, boy, steal away bravely.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,\nCreaking my shoes on the plain masonry,\nTill honour be bought up,\n\nRepeat the entire text."}
